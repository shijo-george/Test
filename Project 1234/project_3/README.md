## 1. Problem Statement

Using Reddit's API, we have collected posts from two subreddits:
* Casual Conversations
* Board Games

Then we will use NLP to train a classifier on which subreddit a given post came from (A binary classification problem).

## Conclusion:

Multinomial Naive Bayes with TFIDF gave the best accuracy score of 96.03%

The other techniques used include:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Multinomial Naive Bayes:
3. RandomForest methods.
4. Ensemble techniques to optimize the models.
