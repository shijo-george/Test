I spent some time looking into metal coins as an upgrade for my games.  I wanted a set that I could use for a variety of games and that had a variety of denominations.  I highly recommend [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/alfl5k/metal_coins_for_board_games_a_compulsion_part_i/) if  you are looking into metal coins.  I ended up settling on the Scythe coins.  There is a good variety and price, and they have just enough theme to be interesting but generic enough to work for a number of games.

&amp;#x200B;

The coins came in plastic bags, I wanted a more interesting way to store them, so I built a custom box for them.  The top is magnetic and each of the divided sections has a rounded bottom so the coins are really easy to get out.

""How long have you been involved in the hobby?” 

Casually since 2011, more heavily since 2015. I followed the typical trend of newcomers to the hobby and my collection ballooned up to almost 200 games at its peak, taking up two additional Kallax shelves. I decided to start heavily culling about a year ago and I'm much happier with my collection now. The better games get played more often and I've gotten some great trades through the experience. 

“What would you change about your collection if you could?” 

Box sizes! I hate large boxes and have limited space in my office/music room/game room. I've started getting rid of big boxes all together (New Frontiers is in the original Concordia box) and combining games (Blue Lagoon + Tiny Towns) that work well together to maximize my space. 

Favorite Games: 

* Food Chain Magnate
* Keyflower
* Tigris &amp; Euphrates
* Go
* Concordia
* Root
* Antiquity
* Spirit Island
* Battlecon
* Dominion (that box has 6 expansions in it)

Newest games: 

New Frontiers - Fantastic tight ""board game"" version of Race. I was skeptical but really enjoyed my plays so far and it's a fast playing easy to teach implementation of the system. 

Tiny Towns - Super simple, but plenty of thought with every action. These are some of our most played and favorite games so this was a welcome surprise. 

Gorus Maximus - Great trick taking game that scales well from 1-6 (and maybe more, but haven't tried that yet). Simple scoring with just enough strategy. Art is fun and plastic cards feel nice. 

Included but not pictured (sharing boxes with other games): Ra the Dice game, Tiny Towns, and Chicago Express. That's Battlecon 2nd edition in the bottom right (with all expansions). 

I also have two math trades coming up where I'm hunting some games such as Knizia's Samurai and Through the Desert as well as The Great Zimbabwe and a few select other games. I definitely plan on keeping my collection below 100 going forward.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/btPyfgJ.jpg""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/btPyfgJ.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If anyone know this game, I'd like to know where to get the official rules in case i'm playing this game wrong.


**Goal:**  

* Have the lowest score at the end of the game (kinda plays like ""No Thanks"")

**Setup:**  

* Everyone is dealt a face up card and a face down card to be placed in their tableau, you may peek at your face down card (secret information)  

* All players are given X amount of chips depending on player count.  

* Rest of cards are placed in the center as a draw deck



**Overview:**  

* Each individual numbered card is worth it's face value.  If your numbered cards are in sequential order AND is of alternating color, you only score the lower number within a given sequence.  

* The face cards are each worth 10 points.  If the face card are part of a complete sequence AND are of alternating color (e.g. R-Jack, B-Queen, R-King), then the sequence scores zero points.   

**A's and Jokers:**  

* Jokers alone are worth 20 points (ouch)

* Aces alone are worth 11 points, unless:  
    
&gt; If paired with a completed face sequence as noted above, the sequence is now worth -11 points  
&gt; If Paired with a numbered sequence as noted above,  the sequence is worth 0 points  
&gt; If paired with a joker, the cards cancel each other    

**Play**

**Step1**:  On your turn, draw the top card of the deck (face up) and choose to either keep it or pass it.  If you pass, you must place a chip on it.  The player to keep the drawn card then takes the next turn. If a player is out of chips, then the player must keep the card 

* If the the active player decides to keep two drawn cards in a row,  he must send out a ""calling card"".  Once the calling card is resolved, play continues like normal (see Step1)  

**Step2**:  In order to resolve a ""calling card,"" the active player draws a face down card (active player may not peek at this card initially), places a chip on it and passes it to the next player.  The next player may peek at the card and choose to keep it or pass it along by placing an additional chip on it.  If the calling card makes it back to the active player, the active player may keep the calling card along with all chips on it and can finally peek, or continue to pass it along by placing a single chip on the card.  Play then resumes as normal, see Step1.  

* If the same active player sends out another calling card, he proceeds to Step2 again, but the active player must now place two chips on it (Three chips if it is their third calling card, etc.).  All other players may continue to pass the calling card by placing a single chip.  

* Calling cards that are kept by players may remain face down, this information is secret to those who chose to pass it along and to the player who decided to keep it.  

**Step3**:  Once the draw deck runs out, the game is over and all players may arrange all their card in manner that scores the least points as noted in the overview.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game plays with a standard 52-deck of cards plus the the jokers.

**Description from Boardgamegeek**:

The survivors of a long-ago invasion have taken refuge in the forgotten underground city of Gravehold. There, the desperate remnants of society have learned that the energy of the very breaches the beings use to attack them can be repurposed through various gems, transforming the malign energies within into beneficial spells and weapons to aid their last line of defense: the breach mages.

Aeon's End is a cooperative game that explores the deckbuilding genre with a number of innovative mechanisms, including a variable turn order system that simulates the chaos of an attack, and deck management rules that require careful planning with every discarded card. Players will struggle to defend Gravehold from The Nameless and their hordes using unique abilities, powerful spells, and, most importantly of all, their collective wits.

I know quite a few games but when you have over 900 it’s hard to know and remember them all!

I found two cards that are missing their game, but I can’t match them. Was hoping someone here might recognize the game!

The first is a small card with a picture of a blender. It says blender and then has some kind of character underneath (Japanese?). It’s a dark card and has a question mark on the back.

The second is a standard size card and it has a red and blue side. They have trivia questions and the background has the numbers 1-6 written on it.

Any info would be helpful if these sound familiar to you, it’s been a mystery trying to match them.

Myself, my wife, and my best friend take games we've never played before and discuss them.  Then we play them (off air) and come back to discuss our reactions.  It's like book club ... but for board games!

Looks like they finally released a bit more info on it and I'm even more surprised to find out that it's going to be a 1-4 player coop game! I really enjoy coops and pretty intrigued to find that they went this route for a city builder.

It's still a bit of a wait as it's supposed to be coming out this October, but I'm really looking forward to giving a coop city builder a try!

[There's a bit more info here](https://www.player.one/cities-skylines-board-game-works-127408) on the game but the details are still sparse.

&gt;For the game itself, it begins with four land boards being visible, though the actual number could vary depending on the scenario being played. The goal is to achieve a certain number of milestones along with ensuring that the inhabitants of the city are happy.

&gt;At the beginning of each milestone, one additional board is flipped from the nature side to the developed side.

&gt;Each player has his or her own personal cards to determine what they are allowed to build. Players need to discuss with each other in order to plan how to develop the city. The cards also provide the effects each building has on the city. When garbage collection is increased, for example, then it has the effect of decreasing crime. There are also cardboard tiles that represent different types of buildings like industrial, commercial, or residential, to name a few. Each have different base shapes and are placed on the developed boards on the grid.

&gt;When developing the city to reach a new milestone, players need to decide what board to buy in order to expand the city and score their current happiness. After that, they can begin working on the next milestone. The game ends once the last milestone is achieved after which the total happiness is obtained.

&gt;It is important to note that the city has one treasury. Players need to add to the treasury when they earn money and take money when buying a new board or building something new. If a player runs out of money, that players goes bankrupt and loses.

The reason I ask is because I quite often play games with my group and *completely* fail to understand the hype. Cyclades, Great Western Trail, Captain Sonar. I've played all these with my regular group, got to the end, and thought ""is that it? Is that *really* what people got so excited about?"" I only play with one group, but I've always wondered, if I was playing those games with some of the many people who love those games, would it be infectious?

Games are already cheapest in the states because of shipping costs but also we have so many discount retailers that anyone who orders online is likely not paying MSRP. So I thought it'd be cool to see what games people recommend that cost less than $25 MSRP so that MAYBE the games are more attainable to people in other countries for around that price point. Here are 5 (well, 6) that I recommend:


1. **Welcome To Your Perfect Home** / **Railroad Ink** ....Both these games play great with high player counts because everyone plays simultaneously. They are also both very portable (especially Railroad Ink) so they're great for a coffee shop or a road trip. Not good for people who like lots of interaction between players as both of these games have little to no interaction aside from in Welcome To with someone attaining goals first, getting a point bonus. They're a relaxing good time though and very satisfying.


2. **Hey! That's My Fish!** ....Don't let the innocent theme fool you, this game is as cutthroat as they come. The most recent edition is practically pocket sized which is awesome but still plays to 4 players. Perfect filler game, but don't be surprised if you play it over and over.


3. **Jaipur** ....I don't actually own this one but have played hours of it online. I prefer this to Splendor however it is only for 2 players but it's a lot of fun in a small box. 


4. **Forbidden Desert** ....This co-op game is hard but its more fun than it is difficult. Great entry level game that experienced players can still have fun with. I find that although one player may try and make decisions for everyone because it is co-op and there are no secret hands, the decisions are so tough to make that everyone discusses and debates every decision, especially in the late game. It's very collaborative.


5. **Citadels: Classic** ....This game has a ton of replay value in such a tiny package. It plays 2-8 (although for me its best with 4-6). Play time is usually around 45 min - 1.5 hours which is unusual for a game that costs less than $15. I personally like the recent edition which has an MSRP of $30 but it's a little more updated and includes expansions but I think this is a great deal for its size and replayability. Some players may not like the ""take that"" aspects of the game but my friends and I like it. 


Honorable Mentions: **Kingdomino** (the Target edition...comes with a tower), **Hanabi** (best deal), **Star Realms** (compact deckbuilder), **Hero Realms** (Fantasy Star Realms for 1-4 out the box, but needs character expansions to make it shine), **Onitama** (zen Chess-like game for 2 players), **The Grizzled** (tough as nails co-op with amazing art), **Kanagawa** (really pretty drafting game for 2-4), **7 Wonders: Duel** (probably my favorite of all these games but it's $5 over the $25 MSRP).


UPDATE: Thanks EVERYONE for posting so many awesome and affordable suggestions. This blew up a lot more than I expected. I think this thread certainly proves that there's a lot of games to be had for $25 or less. I'd go as far as to say if you never spent more than $25 you could still have a solid selection of games to choose from, especially if card, social and gateway games are your preference.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My last post instigated a lot of talk about whether or not there are many worthy games under $25, and also that $25 gets you a lot more/less depending on where you live.

So I’m in a group trying to figure out what game this is. I’m sorry about the flair but I didn’t know what else to put it under. This is a very old game. The op said her mother in law brought it out and said it was the mother in laws father. So I’m guessing at least 50s. Not sure at all. I’ve tried numerous google searches. It’s some kind of peg board game that is two players and has something to do with mining. Any ideas? If I can’t find an answer here the next step is to check with the national board game museum. But I’d like to find an answer without going through all of that.

Do stores in Berlin have a lot of releases they&amp;#39;ll bring back from Essen available for purchase the next week? The FLGS here (I&amp;#39;m American) brings back a bunch for sale at import prices, but not sure if that is common in Berlin to find immediate post-Essen sales or if stores typically wait for distribution given that it&amp;#39;s not really an import.&lt;/p&gt;

Looking through the factions and units in **Monolith Arena**, I noticed they have more going on than the ones in **Neuroshima Hex**.

In the gameplay examples on youtube it seems like the health bars go down way faster than usual.

I've got a group very keen for it.  
Ultimately, I think I'd like to get pretty much everything, but don't have the funds to get all of it in one go. Fortunately Petersen Games have stated they intend to keep it all in print, so I'll have time.

My question is, for those who have played it a lot: in what order would you prioritise the expansions?  

It seems obvious that the playable faction expansions come first (Opener, Sleeper, Windwalker, Ancients, Tcho-Tchos (with new mini expansion), Bubastis, Demon Sultan). I'm likely to grab all these now.

After that, I'm not sure, but currently thinking:  
1. High priests  
2. Plastic bling packs (Color out of Space and Shining Trapezohedron)  
3. Azathoth Neutral faction  
4. Other neutral GOOs (including the box of cats?)
5. Neutral monsters

Somewhere around all the neutral stuff, I'd get the coloured discs, I guess.  

I'm unsure where to place other things in the hierarchy, though:

When do extra maps become worthwhile? I can see they all introduce new rules, so obviously not until everyone has had plenty of time with the base game.  
Do the dreamlands monsters need the dreamlands map to make sense?  
I don't really like the look of the Ramsey Campbell Horrors - the sculpts seem lacking. Are they interesting, gameplay wise? Are the actual figures nicer than the photography would suggest?  
Dice - the base game comes with standard D6s, right, not a set of the custom ones with symbols? Is there benefit to having more than a single set? (i.e are there battles where both sides are rolling more than 10 dice each?) Obviously 240 dice is overkill and is just for faction matching.  
Oversized Earth Map - how crowded does the standard board get with 5p?  
6-8 player maps - does the game still hold up with this many people? Enough to make it worth the hassle?  
9-11 player mat - will almost certainly never bother getting this, even my compulsive collecting has limits

So this past year my son (7th Grade) decided to do his science fair project for the Intel Science Fair on a board game related topic.  What he focused on was creating an algorithm for Machi Koro, base game only, and then use that algorithm to win.  After some trials and adjustments, he was able to create a set of rules to play by that would win close to 90% of the games that he played against myself or my wife. We also took tunrs playing by his set of rules against him, to see how he faired. It was a pretty fun project to do, and it was pretty interesting to watch him develop different strategies that he would adopt.  The hard part for him was to play by the rules regardless of his opponents position.  

&amp;#x200B;

He ended up doing fairly well and won one of the local monetary awards for the algorithm development piece. Several of the judges encouraged him to continue the project on to next year, but he is not sure of a good direction to go.  I figured I would reach out to the community and see if anyone had any suggestions that he could continue with.  Long term he would love to be able to see if he could computer model it into some sort of a game theory AI, but I think that will be a ways off.  He did however start looking into learning Python since a lot of that seems to work off of that language.

&lt;p&gt;This is meant to be a place where you can ask any and all questions relating to the board gaming world: general or specific game recommendations, rule clarifications, definitions of terms/acronyms, and other quick questions that might not warrant their own post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are seeking game recommendations you will get better responses if you give us enough background to help you. You can use &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template-no-explainer""&gt;this template&lt;/a&gt; to do so. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a version with explanations of what we&amp;#39;re looking for.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you reply to any comment that has a game name in &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt; with &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/r2d8""&gt;/u/r2d8&lt;/a&gt; getparentinfo&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;, one of our robots will tell you more about the game&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember that this is a community full of awesome, helpful people, and feel free to ask your questions whatever they may be. As always, keep it civil and remember what the downvote button is actually for.&lt;/p&gt;

The game would have two parts to it. A day in the game would consist of using your party's stamina (a stat that lets you do things in town) to improve it, build buildings, craft items or collect/clear out nearby resources to expand the town. The rest of the day would be going into a random dungeon to kill things, gain experience and acquire more materials and items to improve your town, craft items and progress the story. There would be events that will add more to the story and even add more NPCs to your town thus giving you access to new facilities. I see the town as an empty area consisting mostly of a forest and a field, but as you clear trees you can collect wood which would be used to create storage and other facilities to go with the NPCs that you find. 

&amp;#x200B;

Example of something that can happen; You do a dungeon that at the end there is an NPC that you rescue. Turns out he is an alchemist. For rescuing him he says that if you build him an alchemist's hut (materials listed on his NPC card) he will move into your ton and you will unlock the ability to create potions to take with you on your dungeon delves.

&amp;#x200B;

Other NPCs you can unlock; Blacksmith (Craft Metal Weapons and Heavy Armor from ore), Tanner (Craft Leather Armor and Backpacks to add item slots to your characters when in a dungeon), I have several other ideas but you get the gist of it.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the ""Playable"" Characters there would be a lot of them, a set amount that you start with but many more you can find and unlock to add to your guild over the course of the adventure. I am not exactly sure how the combat system would work, but I know I want it to be hex-based and though I love Gloomhaven, I would want the dungeons to be much smaller and quicker. I want every hero to have it's own unique usefulness in both town and dungeons. 

&amp;#x200B;

An example of what I mean by a Hero's usefulness in town; You have a Barbarian. He has a set amount of stamina. It costs 3 Stamina to cut down a tree to harvest unit of one wood. However his Town ability would give him -1 stamina costs to both his Wood and Ore Mining.

&amp;#x200B;

Happy Tuesday, /r/boardgames!

This is a weekly thread to discuss train games and 18xx games, which are a family of economic train games consisting of shared ownership in railroad companies. For more information, [see the description on BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/19/18xx). There’s also a subreddit devoted entirely to 18xx games, /r/18xx, and a subreddit devoted entirely to **[Age of Steam](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4098/age-steam)**, /r/AgeOfSteam.

Here’s a nice guide on [how to get started with 18xx](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/4sygx3/how_to_get_started_with_18xx/?st=iqny4loj&amp;sh=c01b5d88).

Feel free to discuss anything about train games, including recent plays, what you're looking forward to, and any questions you have. 

If you want to arrange to play some 18xx or other train games online, feel free to try to arrange a game with people via /r/playboardgames.

I will be telling the contents of each product I own. Since there are 7 expansions out as of me writing this and 45 characters available to be played, I thought that I could share what I think about every product I own for the game.

You can find everything I talk about here (Exceptions: Promo drinks and the Adorabomb will require searching through eBay or Amazon): http://slugfestgames.com/games/rdi/

First, some honorable mentions:

Adorabomb prize card: This promo card deals two damage to a player of your choice when you win it in a round of gambling. Prize cards are won in gambling and have a variety of effects. If you can find this for a good price, go for it. It’s a nice addition to any collection. 

Promo drinks: There are far too many promo drinks for me to list. Most don’t add much, but some have interesting effects. If you’re a collector and want to have everything, go for it. Otherwise, I can’t really recommend buying any unless they offer a unique effect (like Compulsive Gambler’s Grog).

Now, the full expansions (Universal contents: Four characters, 50 gold, and a drink deck):

RDI1: This is a great place to start your collection. Four basic characters (my term for characters who have no extra effects) and a easy to learn drink deck makes this a great way to ease newcomers into the game. The characters are Fiona the Volatile, Deidre the Priestess, Gerki the Sneak, and Zot the Wizard. 

RDI3: My first and personal favorite expansion. The drink deck has more interesting drinks, and there are no basic characters. The characters are Wizgille (A risk vs reward gnomish tinkerer), Phrenk (a troll alchemist), Serena (an orc paladin who needs to keep her morals in check), and Kaylin (a pixie who has a pet wolf with mood swings). I highly recommend this to be one of your first few purchases. 

RDI5: The Character Trove. This large box is perfect for a player with multiple RDI products who wants a more efficient way of storing and transporting everything. In addition to the normal contents, it comes with 55 additional gold (45 in platinum coins, each worth 5 gold), foam deck dividers, and deck divider cards for every character and drink deck to come out as of its release. These card deck dividers have the name, picture, and unique rules for each character. The characters are Joran (a mage with an affinity for portals), Sera (a rogue who can string attacks together), Lizwick (a gnome who has a bag full of unique items), and Zakhan (a monk who likes drinking a bit too much). I highly recommend this expansion, just make sure you have a few other products first. 

RDI6: This expansion introduced villains into the game, along with the Dungeon Event deck, team battles, and Boss Fight. The Dungeon Event deck allows events to occur that can harm players, give players some much needed gold, or heal players, just to name a few possible effects. It can also be played with the Sea Event deck from RDI4. Each villain character comes with a Boss deck, something only used in the game modes involving it. The characters are Baron Von Vlazlo (a vampire who can shapeshift), Torglesnarf Duncleton (the self proclaimed goblin king who has minions to do his dirty work), Amundyr (a mummy who uses her pet scarabs to do damage), and Daareka (a Deep One who can control her opponents). I highly recommend this expansion if you are getting bored of normal matches. 

RDI7: This expansion gives the staff of the titular inn a moment in the spot light. It also comes with a new prize card. The characters are The Wench (the woman who brings the best and most potent drinks), Molly the Stablehand (a half elf who really has her hands full), Warthorn Redbeard (the owner of the inn who loves to tell stories), and Jasper the Bouncer (an experienced wizard who doesn’t tolerate any whippersnapper’s backtalk). 

Lastly, Allies expansions (Universal contents: 1/2 characters, 12/25 gold): 

Pooky: This psychotic bunny (Yes, a rabbit) is the familiar of Zot the Wizard. He loves drinking and causing harm. He has a mood card that gets worse as he takes damage. The worse his mood, the worse he’ll hurt you! I highly recommend him as your first Allies character. 

Brother Bastian: A cleric who can call favors from his god, Korash. When he plays certain cards, he gains favor from his god. He can use this favor to play one of 3 prayer cards (which are different every game). While he is fun to play, there are better Allies and even standard characters for you to choose from. 

Wrench: This Kobold is a master of creating helpful and deadly gizmos. Unfortunately, these gizmos don’t differentiate between friend and foe. This is probably one of the best single packaged Allies characters released. While not easy for beginners to play, he’s a ton of fun if you know what you’re doing. 

Keet and Nitrel: Two goblin siblings who love to search for treasure. Keet has a unique artifact deck that he uses instead of gold at the start. These artifacts can either be very helpful or harmful to their owners. Nitrel has a bomb deck that is a blast (pun intended) to use. 

Adonis vs The Lich King: Adonis is the self proclaimed “Bard of the Ages”. He can smash one of his three instruments to give certain cards a boost in strength. The Lich King has only 13 fortitude (all other characters have 20) but also has five fingers. He can remove one finger to completely ignore all damage/alcohol content on a card/drink. Don’t remove your fingers too quickly, or everyone will target you to finish you off. 

Spyke and Flower: This Allies expansion gives you the most for your money. Spyke and Flower are guest characters from Munchkin. They play the same with a treasure deck to power them up. You also get a drink deck, a prize card, and Otto, an automated third player. I highly recommend this expansion. If you want more Munchkin/Red Dragon Inn fun, there is a Red Dragon Inn expansion for Munchkin that comes with a prize card. 

Ohava the Grand Cleric vs Murgath the Blessed: This expansion comes with Ohava, a cleric who uses the blessings of the four gods to aid her, and Murgath, a villain who is stuck with the blessed sword Banefall. Murgath does a lot of damage when attacking, but has to give his victims a blessing card after attacking them. 

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me in the comments.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I begin, I can’t vouch for every character or expansion, since I don’t have all. I will be telling the contents of each product I own. Since there are 7 expansions out as of me writing this and 45 characters available to be played, I thought that I could share what I think about every product I own for the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find everything I talk about here (Exceptions: Promo drinks and the Adorabomb will require searching through eBay or Amazon): &lt;a href=""http://slugfestgames.com/games/rdi/""&gt;http://slugfestgames.com/games/rdi/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, some honorable mentions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adorabomb prize card: This promo card deals two damage to a player of your choice when you win it in a round of gambling. Prize cards are won in gambling and have a variety of effects. If you can find this for a good price, go for it. It’s a nice addition to any collection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Promo drinks: There are far too many promo drinks for me to list. Most don’t add much, but some have interesting effects. If you’re a collector and want to have everything, go for it. Otherwise, I can’t really recommend buying any unless they offer a unique effect (like Compulsive Gambler’s Grog).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the full expansions (Universal contents: Four characters, 50 gold, and a drink deck):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RDI1: This is a great place to start your collection. Four basic characters (my term for characters who have no extra effects) and a easy to learn drink deck makes this a great way to ease newcomers into the game. The characters are Fiona the Volatile, Deidre the Priestess, Gerki the Sneak, and Zot the Wizard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RDI3: My first and personal favorite expansion. The drink deck has more interesting drinks, and there are no basic characters. The characters are Wizgille (A risk vs reward gnomish tinkerer), Phrenk (a troll alchemist), Serena (an orc paladin who needs to keep her morals in check), and Kaylin (a pixie who has a pet wolf with mood swings). I highly recommend this to be one of your first few purchases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RDI5: The Character Trove. This large box is perfect for a player with multiple RDI products who wants a more efficient way of storing and transporting everything.

We quickly realized that we have been playing Pandemic wrong for the better part of a year - we thought you could eradicate a disease by removing all the cubes from the board and not curing it.  So basically we've been playing on super easy mode.  Once we realized that this isn't enough and we still have to cure the diseases things got a lot more difficult.

We had only gotten through January so we kinda stepped back a couple cards and restarted.  Wow, we suck.  By the end of January we had two research stations destroyed, three cities are at a level 5 panic, north america is all basically 2+ panic, we lost both games (game 1 from running out of cards, game 2 from sheer outbreaks), we're both scarred, and we're a little discouraged.

Without spoilers, can we come back from this?  Should we stop playing Legacy for a bit and play regular in order to hone our strategy a little more?  We each play one character, medic/generalist.  I'm tempted to restart again, but my wife gets really discouraged when we lose so hard and if we do that and lose again I don't know if I'll be able to convince her to ever play again.  We want a challenge, but we still want a chance of winning, and apparently we are bad at this game.  At the very least I don't think we'll play a single game without all the funding cards in the deck as sort of a nudge in the win direction.

Edit: Since it's been repeated a bunch I'd just like to say that yes, we forgot to move the outbreak tracker several times, which is why we have so many panics.  I'm gonna either restart or reduce the panics down to 15 or fewer since we lost the first game by running out of cards and the second by too many outbreaks.

&amp;#x200B;

Need some opinions on this game. Love the look and the modular deck system (MDS). My concerns are twofold.

* Static Map - Will it feel the same every time I play?
* Story Development - Same experience just repackaged?

&amp;#x200B;

We have become so accustomed to modular maps. It is an interesting option for the devs to go with a static board. I think this may have a negative effect on the play because it leaves out the exploration aspect we have come to expect in today dungeon crawls.

&amp;#x200B;

The story - I am a lore fanatic and this game seems to only skirt the edges when it comes to immersive story and gameplay. The more I look and read I classify this as a gateway dungeon crawl experience that will have little replayability. I know the MDS will give to diverse replays but with the static board and lack of story/campaign will the MDs alone be enough to get this to the table?

&amp;#x200B;

My intention here is to gather more information on this game and the opinions of others. Have you played the other MDS games? How are the replayability and storyline? Do you see this game as something that will hit the table often or only on rare occasions?

We also have plenty of people who really like building up engines to do cool things and I felt that Tink might fill that roll well. I would also like a stealthy assassin style character, but I haven't found any board game that really seems to capture that archetype. 

One of our members can be very anti randomness and tends to complain if there's much randomness involved, especially dice rolling. They can sometimes be appeased if there are sufficient mechanics to customize the probabilities and reduce variance so I'm not sure if this game could be for them. They do seem to enjoy Space Base, Machi Koro, and Gloomhaven though even with its random modifiers on attacks and random monster actions. They are moving away in a little over a month so might not need to be considered as strongly though being able to drop to 3 players or have someone else drop in as the fourth part way through could greatly help. Another person is similar but to a much lesser degree, the only game I've really seen them complain much about are the King of New York/Tokyo games though sometimes they seem to enjoy those too.

Some things I hope this game could help provide that would differentiate it from Gloomhaven are a faster game time(our Gloomhaven games usually go 3-4 hours with setup and teardown), relatedly reduced opportunities for decision paralysis(which several of our members quite often suffer from) while still having meaningful feeling strategic decisions for each player, a shorter campaign that we could finish in 6 nights or less(possibly playing multiple games a night if we can fit them into 4 hours or less and preferably 4 nights or less), more flexible and faster player customization so that we can always feel our characters are at least somewhat unique to us and fit as best as possible to our personal playstyles. I also think having more goal oriented missions that aren't just kill all X would help, much like descent does just maybe without the intense, artificial feeling time limits.

Is it possible to play this as one off games at different levels without going through a campaign? How hard would it be to artificially level up a character to a specific point and do a mission and/or tyrant fight in one night? So we could experiment with different levels of characters from low to mid to max without having to commit to a campaign.

So any advice on if this game would be a good fit, if not if there are any other games that might be good to look at, and if so what purchase route to start with would be most advised? If we end up getting this and we like it and play it decently often I'll probably end up buying up all the expansions and characters eventually, I am quite the completionist for games I like. If we ever start playing descent second edition again my wallet will never stop crying, so many cool expansions I'd need to find money and space for.

The accepted etiquette (which I've seen in a few in posts around here) seems to be that if you must go while playing you should ~~hold it until the end of the game~~ leave the table right after you play your turn, so that you minimize the chance of holding up the other players.

My favorite games are ones in which this doesn't work—for example, playing **Hansa Teutonica** or **Yellow &amp; Yangtze** recently, when someone has gotten up to go they barely made it out of the room before the game ground to a halt and we had to wait.

\*Edit: Improved formatting.

&amp;#x200B;

*Wednesday*

* **Dragonfire** \- 5.5 - The art was nice, but it’s pretty much a glorified, lengthy 5-Minute Dungeon.
* **Dark Moon** \- 6.5 - Streamlined Infected vs Noninfected game on a space base. Probably better with more people.
* **Tzolk’in: The Mayan Calendar** \- 8.0 - The unique spinning gear mechanic demands the need for planning and timing.

&amp;#x200B;

*Thursday*

* **Too Many Bones: Undertow** \- 8.5 - Cooperative RPG dice builder with a large amount of content and many paths for each class. The insane component quality makes for a high price point.
* **1830: Railways &amp; Robber Barons** \- 4.5 - The 18xx system is a subculture to itself. The teachers pretty much played my game for me. Way too complex for me.

&amp;#x200B;

*Friday*

* **Draftosaurus** \- 5.5 - Simple drafting game with cute dino meeples. Thin, and I don’t see a lot of replayability.
* **Twice as Clever** \- 6.5 - Sequel to That’s Pretty Clever. Plenty of combos. I want to try the original for sure.
* **Proving Grounds** \- 5.0 - Purely solo real-time game. Too much dice luck involved.
* **Tuki** \- 2.5 - More of a toy than a game. Big disappointment from the Azul people.
* **Dobbers: Quest for the Key** \- 6.5 - Indie competitive RPG deck-builder with cool, original comic book art. A lot of thought went into the card designs, but there are some flaws to the gameplay.
* **Too Many Bones** \- 8.5 - I came back to play the full base game demo. I want this so badly, but I’d rather trade for it than buy it.
* **Cartographers: A Roll Player Tale** \- 7.0 - I backed this on Kickstarter. Another card-draw-and-write with high replayability.
* **Abomination: The Heir of Frankenstein** \- 6.0 - The grotesque theme involves building your own monster. The board mechanics were bland though.
* **Copenhagen** \- 6.0 - Pretty tile placement puzzle that I’d probably play the same way every time.
* **Monster Slaughter** \- 4.0 - Everyone plays as a team of monsters competing to kill teenagers. Hilarious theme but too reliant on rolling dice over and over again.
* **Yamatai** \- 5.0 - One or two clever mechanics but way too long for its depth.
* **Welcome To…** \- 8.0 - A friend of mine already showed me this one, but I taught it to two different groups and really fell in love with it. They were selling thematic holiday pads that I just had to buy.
* **Reef** \- 6.5 - Simple and puzzly. Has potential for a higher rating.
* **Carpe Diem** \- 7.5 - Exactly what I’d expect from a drab Stefan Feld game. Clean and well-balanced.

&amp;#x200B;

*Saturday*

* **Pipeline** \- 9.0 - My favorite of the convention. Power Grid-style shared market with a personal (and tough) pipe system mini-game.
* **Naga Raja** \- 6.0 - A fresh 2-player game that might be a little too luck heavy.
* **Legendary Forests** \- 5.0 - Plain ol’ tile-placement game.
* **Bunny Kingdom** \- 7.0 - It looks gimmicky with the bunnie meeples but this was a surprise hit for me. Drafting and area control mechanics. The rules are simple and the turns are fast.
* **Century: A New World** \- 6.5 - Solid worker placement but nothing exciting.
* **Echidna Shuffle** \- 5.5 - Kids game about moving massive hedgehogs to their goal while fucking with other player’s hedgehogs.
* **Teotihuacan: City of Gods** \- 7.0 - Well-balanced with a temple to build that makes for a neat table presence. The dice-moving mechanic is unique but I wasn’t wild about it.
* **Dominion: Empires** \- 8.5 - Recent expansion with a new debt mechanic. I will always want to play Dominion.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I flew solo at Origins 2019 and played a ton of new games.

**How long have you been involved in the hobby?**

Summer of 2012. As of today, I can proudly say I’ve been coming in last place amongst small groups of strangers and friends for seven years. Doesn’t feel that long ago to me, but neither ago does Pepsi Blue, so make of that what you will.

&amp;#x200B;

**What would you change about your collection if you could?**

I present my collection today as a hunter would display a large fox. I’m proud of the shelf but have to admit it’s the piles of games I’ve discarded along the way that probably says more about me as a collector than the image I shared.

Clicking over to my [BG](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/mrdrofficer)[G profile](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/mrdrofficer) proves I’ve sold over half the games I’ve bought over the near decade I've been playing, many of which were only played 1-2 times. People, this hobby is a disease. There was once a time when I cared not of condition or sleeving or meticulously logging my plays, but those days are behind me now as I spend my days reading 17-year-old top 10’s, polishing my Kallax and wishing I went with a 5x5.

&amp;#x200B;

**Favorite game you own**

An original [El Grande (1995)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/93/el-grande) with all expansions.

It’s not the rarest game or with the best condition, but it’s my favorite game. It plays like a good book, always revealing more in its gameplay and demonstrating new mechanical ideas, some stolen by games that came after it or still lie in that box, muses for new ideas yet to come.

&amp;#x200B;

**Newest games**

[In Front of the Elevator](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/278751/front-elevators) was gifted by a friend, which was really nice.

[Rokoko](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/144344/rococo) was my last white whale, which I found in a local game group and basically paid a little over retail for.

And [Maharani](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/118402/maharani) and [Mogul](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174744/mogul) were found at a store with a great older Euro selection and a coffee bar.

But, I would be remiss not to mention that a new friend I started playing with this year has been kind enough to sell me some older euros I’ve been looking forever for and at 1/10 the price if I found them on eBay. Games like - [Aladdin’s Dragons](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/492/aladdins-dragons), [Majaraja](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9440/maharaja-game-palace-building-india), [Australia](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15033/australia), [Metropolys](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/25568/metropolys) and [Hamburgum](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30381/hamburgum). Also, [Ginkgopolis](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128271/ginkgopolis), which ...was not so cheap.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prized possessions**

[Ginkgopolis](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128271/ginkgopolis), [Rokoko](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/144344/rococo), [Colosseum(original)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameversion/26266/days-wonder-english-edition), [Finca (large edition)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/261720/finca-2018-edition), [1st ed.

And the aforementioned [El Grande.](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/93/el-grande)

&amp;#x200B;

**Games that I’m thrilled to play/own but maybe not everyone would care**

[San Marco](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1041/san-marco), [Santiago](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/8125/santiago), [Original Lord of the Rings](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/823/lord-rings), [Majaraja](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9440/maharaja-game-palace-building-india), [Metropolys](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/25568/metropolys), [Australia](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15033/australia), [Gold West](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/154086/gold-westhttps://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/154086/gold-west), and [Stephenson's Rocket](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/204/stephensons-rocket). Also proud to have a near complete collection of [Andreas Steding](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/1018/andreas-steding) and [Mac Gerdts](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/6045/mac-gerdts) games

&amp;#x200B;

**Rarest Game**

[Planet Rush](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/204323/planet-rush), the GMT re-make of [Tower of Babel](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15510/tower-babel) that only 61 people on BGG own.

&amp;#x200B;

**Games might be leaving your collection soon?**

Normally I sell because I don’t like a game, but these days it’s merely for space. [Adrenaline](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/202408/adrenaline), [Acquire](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5/acquire), [Adventure land](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/183231/adventure-land), and others just never got their time in the sun. I’m still trying to get these games played as fast as I can, but time is running out. Also, [Brass: Birmingham](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/224517/brass-birmingham), which I know is sacrilege, but the game just has too many mechanical gaps that I’m not thrilled about.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hoping to play soon.**

[Maharani](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/118402/maharani), [Maharaja](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9440/maharaja-game-palace-building-india), and [Mafiozoo](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/217466/mafiozoo). Or [Hansa Teutonica](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/43015/hansa-teutonica), [Hansa](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/8989/hansa) and [Han](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/153625/han). Whichever.

&amp;#x200B;

**Currently Playing**

[Calimala](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/199383/calimala), [Franchise](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/245645/franchise), [San Marco](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1041/san-marco), [In Front of the Elevator](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/278751/front-elevators) and [Lost Cities: Rivals](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/253398/lost-cities-rivals). Also started an [Imperial Assault](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/164153/star-wars-imperial-assault) campaign with friends recently. But I don’t own that one.

&amp;#x200B;

**Still Looking to find**

[Palaces of Carrara](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/129948/palaces-carrara), [Flinke Pinke](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameversion/26398/amigo-running-coins-edition), [Amyitis](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/29934/amyitis), [Carcassonne: The City](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12902/carcassonne-city) and the [Group SNE version of Winner’s Circle](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameversion/345838/group-sne-japanese-edition). Seriously, It’s adorable.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pre-ordered / Can’t wait for**

There was once a time when I cared not of condition or sleeving or meticulously logging my plays, but those days are behind me now as I spend my days reading 17-year-old top 10’s, polishing my Kallax and wishing I went with a 5x5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite game you own&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An original &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/93/el-grande""&gt;El Grande (1995)&lt;/a&gt; with all expansions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not the rarest game or with the best condition, but it’s my favorite game. It plays like a good book, always revealing more in its gameplay and demonstrating new mechanical ideas, some stolen by games that came after it or still lie in that box, muses for new ideas yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Newest games&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/278751/front-elevators""&gt;In Front of the Elevator&lt;/a&gt; was gifted by a friend, which was really nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/144344/rococo""&gt;Rokoko&lt;/a&gt; was my last white whale, which I found in a local game group and basically paid a little over retail for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/118402/maharani""&gt;Maharani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174744/mogul""&gt;Mogul&lt;/a&gt; were found at a store with a great older Euro selection and a coffee bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I would be remiss not to mention that a new friend I started playing with this year has been kind enough to sell me some older euros I’ve been looking forever for and at 1/10 the price if I found them on eBay. Games like - &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/492/aladdins-dragons""&gt;Aladdin’s Dragons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9440/maharaja-game-palace-building-india""&gt;Majaraja&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15033/australia""&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/25568/metropolys""&gt;Metropolys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30381/hamburgum""&gt;Hamburgum&lt;/a&gt;. Also, &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128271/ginkgopolis""&gt;Ginkgopolis&lt;/a&gt;, which ...was not so cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prized possessions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Games that I’m thrilled to play/own but maybe not everyone would care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1041/san-marco""&gt;San Marco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/8125/santiago""&gt;Santiago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/823/lord-rings""&gt;Original Lord of the Rings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9440/maharaja-game-palace-building-india""&gt;Majaraja&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/25568/metropolys""&gt;Metropolys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15033/australia""&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/154086/gold-westhttps://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/154086/gold-west""&gt;Gold West&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/204/stephensons-rocket""&gt;Stephenson&amp;#39;s Rocket&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rarest Game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/204323/planet-rush""&gt;Planet Rush&lt;/a&gt;, the GMT re-make of &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15510/tower-babel""&gt;Tower of Babel&lt;/a&gt; that only 61 people on BGG own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Games might be leaving your collection soon?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally I sell because I don’t like a game, but these days it’s merely for space. &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/202408/adrenaline""&gt;Adrenaline&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5/acquire""&gt;Acquire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/183231/adventure-land""&gt;Adventure land&lt;/a&gt;, and others just never got their time in the sun. I’m still trying to get these games played as fast as I can, but time is running out. Also, &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/224517/brass-birmingham""&gt;Brass: Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;, which I know is sacrilege, but the game just has too many mechanical gaps that I’m not thrilled about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hoping to play soon.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This includes the award winning Happy Salmon (2016), its companion Funky Chicken (2018), and the more recent Monster Match (2018). All of these games come with a highly amusing creature-shaped plush packaging, and follow a similar formula for success: games that can be learned in only a minute or two, play extremely quickly, and are high on fun, energy, and laughs.  The latest addition to this series is [**Dirty Pig**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/118410/dirty-pig), a game for 2-6 players by Frank Bebenroth that originally came out in 2012, and was praised as a 2012 Spiel des Jahres Recommended title, and 2012 Fairplay A la carte Winner.  Now North Star is bringing it to the American market as part of their Happy Planet line.

**COMPONENTS**

Like the other Happy Planet titles, our first impression of the game comes courtesy of the cute packaging. It's made out of the same plush style material (which feels similar to mouse pad material) used for the other games in the Happy Planet series, with a zipper that gives us easy access to all the game components inside, and is shaped like an actual pig.   It contains 75 cards and instructions.  All the cards have cartoon-like artwork that helps produce a light-hearted feel appropriate for the game.   Some slight changes have been made to the original game, mostly to increase the player count to include 5-6 player games.

**GAME-PLAY**

Game-play is simple: all players get 3-5 Pig cards (depending on player count), and the aim is to flip all of these over from the Clean Pig side to the Dirty Pig side.  On your turn you play one of the three action cards in your hand and then replenish back to three cards.  Cards do things like dirtying your pig, washing opponent's pigs, attacking your opponents pigs with rain or lightning, and defending your own pigs with a barn, barn door, or lightning rod.  First player to get all their pigs dirty wins the game.

**IMPRESSIONS**

This is the kind of game you can literally learn in just a couple of minutes or so.  Granted, there's not much depth of decision making in this game, but that's fine given the kind of game that it is.   There's some \`take that', since you're either playing cards to protect your own pigs and make them dirty, or ones that mess up your opponent's plans.   But it's all fast and fun, and the simple game-play and ""take that"" elements make it a good fit for the ""Happy Planet"" product line. The silly theme and the artwork also help with this a lot.  I suspect this game will be most enjoyed by families and with children, or with non-gamers.

**RECOMMENDATION**

The Happy Planet series isn't really intended to consist of games that are suitable for gamers, and Dirty Pig is no exception. So I wouldn't really even recommend this as a filler for gamers.   But would I recommend it? Sure. It is a perfect fit for families with children, or even to pull out with non-gamers who don't normally play games. It has the perfect ingredients to be a big hit with this target market: charming looks, a unique theme, and easy-to-learn gameplay, while being fun to play courtesy of the interactive \`take that' elements.

Once again North Star Games is helping make our planet a happier place, and with Dirty Pig on your table, you can be confident of producing smiles on the faces of children, families, and non-gamers in years to come.

All of these games come with a highly amusing creature-shaped plush packaging, and follow a similar formula for success: games that can be learned in only a minute or two, play extremely quickly, and are high on fun, energy, and laughs.  The latest addition to this series is &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/118410/dirty-pig""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dirty Pig&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a game for 2-6 players by Frank Bebenroth that originally came out in 2012, and was praised as a 2012 Spiel des Jahres Recommended title, and 2012 Fairplay A la carte Winner.  Now North Star is bringing it to the American market as part of their Happy Planet line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COMPONENTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the other Happy Planet titles, our first impression of the game comes courtesy of the cute packaging. It&amp;#39;s made out of the same plush style material (which feels similar to mouse pad material) used for the other games in the Happy Planet series, with a zipper that gives us easy access to all the game components inside, and is shaped like an actual pig.   It contains 75 cards and instructions.  All the cards have cartoon-like artwork that helps produce a light-hearted feel appropriate for the game.   Some slight changes have been made to the original game, mostly to increase the player count to include 5-6 player games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GAME-PLAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game-play is simple: all players get 3-5 Pig cards (depending on player count), and the aim is to flip all of these over from the Clean Pig side to the Dirty Pig side.  On your turn you play one of the three action cards in your hand and then replenish back to three cards.  Cards do things like dirtying your pig, washing opponent&amp;#39;s pigs, attacking your opponents pigs with rain or lightning, and defending your own pigs with a barn, barn door, or lightning rod.  First player to get all their pigs dirty wins the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMPRESSIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of game you can literally learn in just a couple of minutes or so.  Granted, there&amp;#39;s not much depth of decision making in this game, but that&amp;#39;s fine given the kind of game that it is.   There&amp;#39;s some `take that&amp;#39;, since you&amp;#39;re either playing cards to protect your own pigs and make them dirty, or ones that mess up your opponent&amp;#39;s plans.   But it&amp;#39;s all fast and fun, and the simple game-play and &amp;quot;take that&amp;quot; elements make it a good fit for the &amp;quot;Happy Planet&amp;quot; product line. The silly theme and the artwork also help with this a lot.  I suspect this game will be most enjoyed by families and with children, or with non-gamers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RECOMMENDATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Happy Planet series isn&amp;#39;t really intended to consist of games that are suitable for gamers, and Dirty Pig is no exception. So I wouldn&amp;#39;t really even recommend this as a filler for gamers.   But would I recommend it? Sure. It is a perfect fit for families with children, or even to pull out with non-gamers who don&amp;#39;t normally play games. It has the perfect ingredients to be a big hit with this target market: charming looks, a unique theme, and easy-to-learn gameplay, while being fun to play courtesy of the interactive `take that&amp;#39; elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again North Star Games is helping make our planet a happier place, and with Dirty Pig on your table, you can be confident of producing smiles on the faces of children, families, and non-gamers in years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Is it just me, or does it feel like the public masses are sometimes extraordinarily unengaged when it comes to board games? Don't get me wrong, I'm very aware of the phrase, ""It's easier to turn gamers into friends than friends into gamers."" But that doesn't mean we should never share our hobby with non-gamers or that they should be completely unengaged. For example, if a friend or relative wanted to introduce me to their hobbies, I'd at least show some level of curiosity and maybe agree to watch them participate or even try it out myself. I know for a fact I'm not good at rock-climbing because I'm really overweight and unfit. I still tried it years ago when my cousin and brother were really into it, and I'd try it again today just for poops and chuckles.

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to board games though, I feel like a lot of people just shut down. Maybe it's just the ones I've tried it with. I like to play board games with relatives whenever we visit for holidays and whatnot. The funny thing is, they seem to be completely open to the idea as well. My aunt used to regularly buy my siblings and I board games growing up and we have many great memories of playing classics like **Clue** together. I've had a lot of success with some games like **Carcassonne**. We also play a lot of **Phase 10**, although I'm not a huge fan of the game, but I enjoy spending time with family more than I loathe playing the game. When it comes to anything above those simple games in ""complexity"", I just get dead reactions. I use quotes because as I'm sure many of you know, a lot of non-gamers perceive unfamiliar mechanisms as complexity, even though they might technically be simple. I consider worker placement to be a very simple concept to understand, and the gameplay implications from contending over locations made themselves very apparent to me within minutes of my first time playing such a game. But it seems that if a game does anything other than roll-to-move or play-a-card, that automatically drives the perceived complexity way up for my relatives. I suppose one could argue that side-stepping is really hard after walking forwards one's entire life, but I still don't think it's all that hard to at least try and learn. I mean, we're not talking about going out and getting a Ph.D. in molecular physics.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, I was teaching and playing **The Godfather: Corleone's Empire** with family. This is a game my mostly non-gamer wife absolutely loves because she considers it one of the simpler but deeper games in our collection. She picked it up pretty much instantly despite it being her first worker placement game, and we can fly through 2-player matches at a brisk pace in about 40 minutes. When I took a bunch of games to our family get-together to choose from, everyone was immediately drawn to this game. They were all doing Marlon Brando impressions before I could even tell them about the other games. Needless to say, thematic engagement was not lacking. But when we started playing, each round was taking about an hour (the game consists of 5 rounds if I remember correctly), and they were constantly getting confused over what I consider to be really trivial things. For example, one of the first concepts I explained was that the general flow of the game is that you either visit locations or complete jobs which reward you with money, and then you have to go to other locations to launder those bills into your suitcase for them to count in final scoring. If you understand this basic idea, much of the rest of the game becomes very intuitive. Yet players were constantly mixing up the resource requirements for finishing jobs on the left side of the job cards with the rewards for job completion listed at the bottom of the job cards, so they were trying to do things like spend money to complete a job to get resources, which is completely backwards. Likewise, they didn't seem to grasp the basic concept of a worker placement game, which is that the most common action is placing a worker, and the round is over when all workers have been placed. Sure, there are alternative actions such as completing a job or playing an ally card, but the standard action is generally placing a worker. Players were constantly asking which cards they could play from their hands, as if we were playing **Uno**.

&amp;#x200B;

On the one hand, I totally understand that modern games are foreign and new to many people. These relatives of mine are largely familiar with old classics like the ones I mentioned, so I get that I need to unteach them outdated mechanisms and try to elaborate on newer design concepts. But it just seems to me that they didn't really put in enough effort to meet me half way. I know they're smart enough to learn these things. This particular game is not that hard (again, my wife can testify to this, because she really struggles with heavier games, but this one comes very naturally to her). Yes, there are lots of options at any given moment, but for the most part, the game largely holds your hand and suggests the optimal course of action. Like if you have gray job cards, you're not going to waste your time collecting resources other than the gray weapons cards you need to complete them. And for what it's worth, I did ease them up to this level by starting with **Carcassonne**, which went over really well with the exact same group just a couple of weeks earlier at a different event.

&amp;#x200B;

My father used to work as an installer for cable and satellite companies, and he used to always tell me stories about how many of the elderly customers were just decades behind on knowing how to use even the most basic of technology. He would get called back to ""fix"" bad installs, only to find that they didn't know how to use the volume buttons on their TV remotes, or they forgot to plug their TV back in to the power outlet after cleaning around the house. It happened so often and was such a major hassle because the companies would essentially dock pay based on repeat instances and things like that, to the point that he just started giving everyone his personal number and telling them to call him before scheduling follow-up appointments, because 99.99% of the time, it was something trivial like this that he could fix in an instant without getting the company involved. My point is not to ridicule these people. I get that change is difficult. But I also struggle to see how people can justify that level of ignorance and lack of adaptability. I mean, you would think at some point between the invention of the TV and today with Netflix and all these other services that somebody would have picked up the concept of changing input sources, or at the very least plugging something into a wall outlet. Unless they have serious mental issues, which I do acknowledge are increasingly common with age, I feel like they should at least be able to function on the most basic of levels, or just accept the consequences of not being able to, which in that case would be giving up TV.

&amp;#x200B;

It feels frustrating to me to try to teach a game which yes, is new, but no, is not that hard, and I know from experience can be picked up relatively quickly by someone intelligent who is otherwise uninterested in games, and to see that the players were so engaged in the theme and wanting to play, only to have them just freeze up when it's not **Monopoly**. I actually really intended to teach **Dice Forge** specifically because I thought rolling dice and letting them determine the outcome of the game would largely be more suited for this group, but they insisted from the get-go that they wanted to play **The Godfather: Corleone's Empire**. In retrospect, I'm not really sure there's anything I could have done. They were going to struggle no matter what it was, because they don't really want to leave their comfort zone of **Uno**. It's just sad that they're so stuck in such an old and tiny zone. I'm sure this happens in other hobbies, but I'm not sure I can think of many where I've witnessed it to the same extent. Music is probably the most obvious example. Many people just listen to what they grew up with and hate everything else. But even then, I find that people are at least willing to try listening to different genres, and also, opinions of music are more about feeling than actually doing something. I've never witnessed somebody listening to a genre of music for the first time complain that their ears suddenly stopped working, which seems more analogous to what I've experienced with board games and people just not being able to grasp the basic mechanisms.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, enough ranting from me. Feel free to chime in with your thoughts and experiences. Again, I'm very much in the camp of not trying to force people to like my games, but when they say they want to play and then can't pick up anything because they're so lost in 1950's Parker Brothers land, words offer little comfort, haha.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apologies if this is a repost.

So I made this ultra-portable version of the game: [https://imgur.com/a/aiBVYYN](https://imgur.com/a/aiBVYYN)

I used the Portable Edition of the Settlers of Catan as a guide for the map. The tile numbers, the location of the desert, and the port locations are fixed and a bit different from the normal game, but you still get to randomize what resource is on which tile.

*Keep in mind that with the info in this post you can essentially pirate the game, so do buy a copy from your friendly local game store and throw Klaus Teuber, father of the board game renaissance, a few bucks.*

1. **Map**. Print the map from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QsvMt4_19tZkCUYu3ASUdqPgNhLAcgtw) and colour in the tiles based on whatever randomizing method you like. The centre tile is the desert, and for the rest you need 4 of wheat, wool, and lumber and 3 of ore and brick. Four of the ports (triangles) should be 3:1 multipurpose ports, with each of the others given to one of the five resources. Each map will only be good for one game, so make 4-6 to start.
2. **Resources**. I used 5 different colours of Fimo oven-bake clay to make tiny little resource cubes (19 of each). Try to match their colours to the colours you used on the map.
3. **Cards**. This one was the hardest because the backs of the cards shouldn't give away what the card actually gives you. I cannibalized a LotR Risk card deck, but you could use whatever, including regular playing cards, if you come up with a system for which card means what. The breakdown for these is: 14 knights, 5 victory points, 2 monopolies, 2 years of plenty, 2 road building.
4. **Roads and cities**. This was my main breakthrough. In the game, they're little plastic game pieces, but *once you build a thing you never have to move it* (except to turn a settlement into a city). So, I just have one pencil per player, each with a different colour, and I draw lines when they build roads and circles at the intersections when they build settlements. If a settlement turns to a city, I draw another circle around the first one. It is surprisingly easy to convert, as long as you know the maps are single use. The game places a limit on how many of each thing you can get (15 roads, 5 settlements, ~~3~~ 4 cities), but you'll just have to count those instead.
5. **Misc**. You'll need a robber (black orc works great), some way to award/denote Largest Army and Longest Road victory conditions, and two six-sided dice.

I think that's the gist of it. You can make this as big or small as you like.

The game places a limit on how many of each thing you can get (15 roads, 5 settlements, &lt;del&gt;3&lt;/del&gt; 4 cities), but you&amp;#39;ll just have to count those instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Misc&lt;/strong&gt;. You&amp;#39;ll need a robber (black orc works great), some way to award/denote Largest Army and Longest Road victory conditions, and two six-sided dice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that&amp;#39;s the gist of it. You can make this as big or small as you like.&lt;/p&gt;

I have never before played Warhammer or other wargames. Strategy board games I usually enjoy are more akin to Star Wars: Imperial Assault, Game of Thrones. I'm also a Magic: the Gathering fan but burnt out on the costs.

In the starting pack you get two fully playable 'Warbands', which you can customize fully with included cards but also cards from other Warbands. It works very well, and the value you get for 20 euro per Warband (at three to seven beautiful figurines and a couple of cards) seems pretty good.

All this wouldn't matter if the gameplay wasn't really, really solid. An average game usually doesn't take much longer than an average Magic card game (30-45 minutes max) and in that time it feels like you constantly make tactical and meaningful decisions. Each warband plays very different from others, including the same warbands due to the choice of cards you have to customize your deck. 

The small size also means it's surprisingly portable, and there seems to be a quite active tournament scene where I live. To me, it seems like the perfect collectible strategy game for busy adults and it scratches my strategy itch while also filling the void MTG left behind. The only con I can think of is that I'm sure it'll be quite expensive to play competitive in the long run, but probably not as expensive as many other games. And the beautiful models make up for it.

Was anyone else pleasantly surprised by this game?

Can’t find any reviews of this one, so I thought I’d share our thoughts from our first game.  Also posted this on BGG.  **TLDR** at the bottom.

We picked up Dead Man's Cabal at Origins 2019 (the first place for it to be available anywhere) and got it to the table today.

**First Impression:**

The production (box art, card art, and components) is immediately impressive and probably the biggest draw of Dead Man's Cabal. We love the physical feel and look of the game! Kudos to Denis Medri for the artwork!

Setting up the game is quickly jarring as your realize that one-third of the large punch outs are completely pointless ""hallways"" (for esthetics only) to connect the other rooms (action and scoring boards). Using these extra punch outs to arrange all the boards however you want simply takes up much more space on your table, but it perhaps helps the game to look slightly less chaotic. The miniature punch out tokens (62 rune tokens) are also a bit of the pain to randomly shuffle and arrange or stack on their respective board.

The skulls and bones, on the other hand, are great. They provide nice detail and density and feel great to constantly collect, draw, and spend. My only complaint is that the gold skulls are MUCH darker (almost resembling black skulls) than the back of the box shows.


**Gameplay**

While Dead Man's Cabal has fairly simple rules, the depth and complexity of the game lies in its long turns, many decisions, and scoring objectives. 

In a single turn you do the following: 
1. Draw a skull out of a bag
2. Decide which row to add it to: this single decision will affect the possible public actions, future potential public actions, and the skull color you receive
3. Collect the skull that was pushed out of that row
4. Spend a specific skull in your supply to select your private action: the color you spend determines the action
5. Execute the private action: Within this action you must decide to do a weak version of that action and receive a bone(s) or spend a bone(s) and do a better version of that action
6. Select a public action
7. All players execute the public action in a clockwise order, again deciding how much to gain from that action depending on if they gain or spend bones

While none of these individual parts of a single turn are complex, weaving all of them together into a massive glob of optimal decisions created quite the slow down in our 2 player game. Analysis Paralysis, though never unbearably long, was a constant occurrence that slowed down almost every turn. The public action that all players execute on every turn is the only thing that saves this game from committing design suicide via downtime. Even after 15/20 minutes of playing, when we understood exactly what was going on in the game, we still did not speed up each round by much.

The four possible actions (both private and public) include collecting more skulls, collecting more cards (dead people), collecting rune tokens, and placing skulls in the sanctum (connecting colors by lines) to then play cards with rune tokens (bringing people back from the dead). The most interesting action by far is this last action, referred to as Completing Rituals.

When you place skulls into the Sanctum, this will not only set up you to meet the card's required cost, but it will also help or hurt your opponents, as only one of these skull will be removed from the sanctum after you play down a card. In addition to earning the points from playing that card, you may also play up to two matching rune tokens (if you collected them on a previous action) to be able to place up to two cubes on the end game bonus score board. 

That bonus score board has a variety of bonuses that are each only awarded to the player with the most cubes and second most cubes on that specific bonus (although second place receives half the bonus points, rounded up). These bonuses include 4 points for each unspent skull, 5 points for each skull of a specific color that you used to perform Rituals (play your cards), 20 points, and more. This provides for some nice strategy and interaction between players, but it also results in a ridiculous amount of math at the end game scoring.

**Conclusion:**

The production is great! The decisions and strategy are interesting. The player interaction is fairly strong, as almost everything a player takes, spends, and strives to earn points for directly affects others.

The turns are long and thinky. The game is prone to regular AP thanks to the many decisions one must make in a single turn. The end game scoring includes a ridiculous amount of points (for better or for worse) and requires a lot of math.

I'm both excited and afraid to play this game with more people. I feel that the game will be stronger with 3 or 4 players, due to having more competition with the bonus objectives, more turnover with the available cards and skulls, less astronomical math per player (the winner of our 2 player game scored nearly 250 points), etc. But playing with more people will certainly make the game even longer and slower (as the end game condition remains the same and having more players does not really accelerate those conditions), a prospect that I do not look forward to.

We want to play Dead Man's Cabal again, but I currently have no intention of keeping it for long.

**TLDR**
Interesting decisions, great production, but the long turns with many steps (simple as they may individually be) are prone to regular AP leading to longer down time and slower turns. The end game scoring results in an almost annoying amount of points per player, especially in a two player game.

We enjoyed it, we'll play it again, but I don't see this one staying in our collection for long.

Has anyone else played this yet?  I’m curious to hear other people’s opinions.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/gallery/x8io03C""&gt;https://imgur.com/gallery/x8io03C&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can’t find any reviews of this one, so I thought I’d share our thoughts from our first game.  Also posted this on BGG.  &lt;strong&gt;TLDR&lt;/strong&gt; at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We picked up Dead Man&amp;#39;s Cabal at Origins 2019 (the first place for it to be available anywhere) and got it to the table today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Impression:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production (box art, card art, and components) is immediately impressive and probably the biggest draw of Dead Man&amp;#39;s Cabal. We love the physical feel and look of the game! Kudos to Denis Medri for the artwork!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up the game is quickly jarring as your realize that one-third of the large punch outs are completely pointless &amp;quot;hallways&amp;quot; (for esthetics only) to connect the other rooms (action and scoring boards). Using these extra punch outs to arrange all the boards however you want simply takes up much more space on your table, but it perhaps helps the game to look slightly less chaotic. The miniature punch out tokens (62 rune tokens) are also a bit of the pain to randomly shuffle and arrange or stack on their respective board.&lt;/p&gt;

6. Select a public action

____________________________________________


We are many, but one.


Our hands clutch tender journey-fragments, temporal puzzle pieces. Together, they are shards of a fragile destiny. When we are one -- when our rhythm rings out in single melody, hearts beating as clockwork, souls aligned -- we assemble the shards with ease, each one flowing into the next with casual effortlessness, bringing us ever-greater glories. We are glowing, gazing, dancing, cutting, splitting away from corporeal form, spirit unified, ascended.

 

We have exceptional triumphs. We bridge vast gulfs of understanding, unleash rapid-fire barrages of pure insight, resolve tumult and chaos with sublime clarity. These moments are nigh ubiquitous, yet each one steals our voices and molds them into more, shapes our breath into conjoined revelry, shrill exultation. Victory is anything but quiet.


Not so when we are many. When we are many  -- when our tempos collapse in cacophonous dissonance, eyes flickering under the shadow of doubt, spirits disjoint -- the pieces in our hands contort into hieroglyphs beyond human understanding, glowing fragments writhing under the weight of their own incomprehensibility, amphigory defined. We are fading, failing, stumbling, tearing, relapsing into a more primitive existence, our spirits broken, denied.


Do we turn to the Stars for salvation? Do we call upon those capricious flecks of light -- so precious, so fleeting -- to save us from ourselves? Or do we press on in darkness, fueled by bated impulse, and risk damnation at hubris' hands? Whichever we choose, we press on, for the promise of grandeur itches in our minds, gnawing at us, corroding our sensibilities, driving us to madness. Perhaps now, we think again. Perhaps this time.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244992/mind""&gt;The Mind&lt;/a&gt; was one of the best board games of 2018. I&amp;#39;ve played it with a ton of different groups and all but 1 person has loved it. At least 5 people have already bought it, with many more considering buying it. It has been by far the most cost-efficient piece of entertainment I&amp;#39;ve ever bought. That&amp;#39;s why I wrote it a &lt;a href=""https://weiright.blogspot.com/2019/06/the-mind-love-letter.html""&gt;love letter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are many, but one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our hands clutch tender journey-fragments, temporal puzzle pieces. Together, they are shards of a fragile destiny. When we are one -- when our rhythm rings out in single melody, hearts beating as clockwork, souls aligned -- we assemble the shards with ease, each one flowing into the next with casual effortlessness, bringing us ever-greater glories. We are glowing, gazing, dancing, cutting, splitting away from corporeal form, spirit unified, ascended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have exceptional triumphs. We bridge vast gulfs of understanding, unleash rapid-fire barrages of pure insight, resolve tumult and chaos with sublime clarity. These moments are nigh ubiquitous, yet each one steals our voices and molds them into more, shapes our breath into conjoined revelry, shrill exultation. Victory is anything but quiet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not so when we are many. When we are many  -- when our tempos collapse in cacophonous dissonance, eyes flickering under the shadow of doubt, spirits disjoint -- the pieces in our hands contort into hieroglyphs beyond human understanding, glowing fragments writhing under the weight of their own incomprehensibility, amphigory defined. We are fading, failing, stumbling, tearing, relapsing into a more primitive existence, our spirits broken, denied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do we turn to the Stars for salvation? Do we call upon those capricious flecks of light -- so precious, so fleeting -- to save us from ourselves? Or do we press on in darkness, fueled by bated impulse, and risk damnation at hubris&amp;#39; hands? Whichever we choose, we press on, for the promise of grandeur itches in our minds, gnawing at us, corroding our sensibilities, driving us to madness. Perhaps now, we think again. Perhaps this time.&lt;/p&gt;

I want to clarify that this doesn't mean that a game has bad rules, rules that are up for interpretation, or rules that prevent you from playing the game the way it is intended to play. This also isn't a discussion of ""make games less/more rigid"" but rather of given two games, one with very rigid, potentially limiting, rule set or one with a rule set that provides a bit more freedom, which one do you prefer/avoid.  


If you're still confused, i apologise, i'm not great at explaining this concept. Let me provide an example! There's a little game i quite enjoy, **Hellapagos**, where it is basically a game of survivor. The game provides a set of rules that describe what happens each round, what actions players are able to take, and what happens at the end of the round. The rules also say you can play cards *whenever* you want, you can talk about *whatever* you want, and it doesn't provide a limitation of how long a discussion should lasts when they happen. Alternatively, if the rules were more rigid it might say something like, can only play 1 card on your turn, can only talk about what action you're going to take, and discussions should only last 3 mins.  ^((on an aside, I understand that certain games require rigidity and others don't, imo Hellapagos with the rigid rule set in the above would make the game a poor experience))

  
Tangentially, i want to know if you guys prefer if the rule book explicitly states whether or not players should use a variant to play. For example, card game X has a drafting and non drafting variant, however playing X at 4-5 players using the drafting variant would take hours and 50% of players agree it is a sub-par experience. Would you rather the rule book explicitly say something like ""do not use draft at 4-5 players"" or leave it be and let the players play the way they want.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to know if you guys dislike games with less rigid rules.   &lt;/p&gt;

- My interactive AirTable view of [all active board game kickstarter campaigns](https://airtable.com/shrL0m86v0xDjRKbe).
- BoardGameGeek's variety of [Kickstarter-oriented Geeklists](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/166152/kickstarter-project-metalist)

## Footnotes
- `#hmm` means that something about the project seems a little off. Buyer beware kinda thing.
- `#lolwut` is reserved for projects that seem like copycat games or campaigns put together with little thought. Check 'em out for amusement.
- `#take` tags are for projects that have been restarted for some reason, with the number indicating what iteration we're currently on.
- Did I miss something? Particularly something **new in the last 7 days** or **ending in the next 7 days**? Let me know in the comments and I'll add it in.

## Help Keep This Running
These lists take time and money to put together. Not a lot, but a little. If you enjoy them, maybe [toss me a buck](https://www.paypal.me/Zelbinian/1) now and then. 

[Signing up for a free AirTable account](https://airtable.com/invite/r/wJL1rj8U) via my referral link can help, too. Plus, it's swell!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this is:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter board game projects that are either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;newly posted in the past 7 days&lt;/strong&gt;, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ending in the next 7 days (starting Jun 17)&lt;/strong&gt; and have at least a fighting chance of being funded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, &lt;strong&gt;no need to ask.&lt;/strong&gt; (The occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between midnight and noon PST.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ending Soon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;#hmm&lt;/code&gt; means that something about the project seems a little off. Buyer beware kinda thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;#lolwut&lt;/code&gt; is reserved for projects that seem like copycat games or campaigns put together with little thought. Check &amp;#39;em out for amusement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;#take&lt;/code&gt; tags are for projects that have been restarted for some reason, with the number indicating what iteration we&amp;#39;re currently on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did I miss something? Particularly something &lt;strong&gt;new in the last 7 days&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;ending in the next 7 days&lt;/strong&gt;? Let me know in the comments and I&amp;#39;ll add it in.&lt;/li&gt;

Lately I've been trying to work my collection back down to just this one 2x4 and failing miserably, as not included in this picture are **Gloomhaven**, **Cerebria**, **Scythe,** and a big box of **Ultimate Werewolf** cards on a separate shelf. I generally try to trade and/or buy used, I'd say about 12-15 of the games shown were bought or traded for secondhand.

&amp;#x200B;

In general I prefer medium to heavy games and my favorite mechanics are area control and negotiation. Social deception was what got me into playing modern board games in the first place and I still love me some bluffing/lying games, though I sort of consider it a distinct category apart from ""typical"" board games these days.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a huge sucker for an interesting historical theme and I dearly want to get more of the GMT COIN series (particularly **A Distant Plain**), but I'm pretty sure in my current situation I'll never get to play them so for now I live in disappointment.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not much of a Kickstarter-er but I do throw down for expansions for games I own or stuff by designers I like here and there.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love to hear some other stuff people think I'd be interested in or to chat about the stuff on the shelf.

&amp;#x200B;

*In those bottom two bins:*

**Raiders of the North Sea + Fields of Fame + Hall of Heroes**

**Vast: The Crystal Caverns + Fearsome Foes**

**Battle for Rokugan**

**Santorini**

**Splendor**

**Azul**

**Coup**

**The Resistance**

**Don't Mess With Cthulhu**

**Grifters + Grifters: Nexus**

&amp;#x200B;

*In my leather card case that you can't see behind Terraforming Mars:*

**Not Alone + Not Alone: Exploration**

**Battle Line**

**Werewords**

**The Fox in the Forest**

**Love Letter**

**Jaipur**

&amp;#x200B;

*Top Five:*

**Dominant Species** \- Easy to teach and amazing to play.

**Sidereal Confluence** \- The best pure negotiation game ever made.

**A Game of Thrones** \- Actually the first modern non-social deduction board game I ever played, and still love it.

**Spirit Island** \- Terrific co-op strategy game. Love how each spirit's theme comes through on the board.

**Fury of Dracula** \- I previously owned Letters from Whitechapel as well, FoD is longer and more complex but beats it out in every way.

&amp;#x200B;

*New additions:*

**Gaia Project**

**John Company**

**The Estates** \- This is an amazing and cutthroat auction game.

**Forbidden Stars**

&amp;#x200B;

*Recently Backed:*

**Anachrony Infinity Box**

**Stockpile**

**Spirit Island: Jagged Earth**

&amp;#x200B;

*Coming Soonish:*

**Pax Pamir 2E**

**Root: The Underworld Expansion**

**Terraforming Mars: Turmoil**

&amp;#x200B;

*On the Way Out:*

**Path of Light and Shadow** \- Just not really a fan of deck builders at all. I've played this and **Eschaton** a couple times each and just have no interest in the mechanic. The area control aspect was what lured me in both times.

**New Angeles:** I actually really enjoy this game, but it seems like it has a very specific player requirement of 5-6 to stay balanced. If I had 5-6 people up for a long-ish complex game with negotiation I'd rather go for **Sidereal Confluence, A Game of Thrones, Rex,** etc. Still torn on trading or selling it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/gShna5X.jpg""&gt;Behold!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I wanted to share with you this new fever i have : buying new games.

I have a fair collection of games, some of which i played twice, some others i haven’t played yet, but i am always interested in buying new games...

Right now i want to buy :
- Orleans
- Aeon’s End
- Tiny towns
- Architects of the Western Kingdom.

Not only games cost money, but also need storing space.


How do you overcome that urge to widen your collection?

&amp;#x200B;

It's a wargame played on a hex map with 2 fantasy factions. Very basic rules, but what makes the game interesting is that it isn't turn-based, it's real time. Each player has 4 sand timers (1 30 second, 2 60 second, and 1 90 second) and each timer is one action. Once a timer runs out it can be used to make another action. So games run very quickly (10 minutes or less I'd say) and it's pretty frantic at times.

&amp;#x200B;

I've only played it once, and I had a good time. I think the system is really interesting and the strategy has some depth to it. Thinking quickly in these sorts of games is new to me. The components could definitely use some work, though. Little to no artwork throughout the game and some of the counters weren't die-cut very well. I also had a timer get stuck at one point, which obviously can ruin a game. I tested it afterwards and it worked fine, though. 

&amp;#x200B;

A non-component gripe I have about the game is the lack of a point system. It comes with 10 scenarios with pre-set terrain and units. It could really benefit from the option to build your own army for scenarios. The system could definitely support that, but it's not in this game.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just pretty confused as to why this game has gotten so little attention. Only 54 people have rated it on BGG. I think it's a fun and very innovative system, and deserves some more love. Anyone else who's played it, what's your thoughts?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/218503/wartime-battle-valyance-vale""&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/218503/wartime-battle-valyance-vale&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

EDIT: Thank you for all the responses! I seriously didn’t think I would get so many. Many are saying to get over losing, but you have to remember we all have different personalities. I am a competitive woman and enjoy winning, because of that I don’t often lose when my husband isn’t around.

We just played Munchkin for the first time and with some friends and I WON WOOT!

I recently got into garage saling (I go pretty much every weekend). This weekend I came across a cool looking board game called “The Shadow Game” from 1940. I thought it might be worth a little money and I liked the graphics so worst case I would display it. I can’t find much information on the game except that there were two that sold a few years back for around $800 each. For that price I will be selling it. I guess I was wonder if there is a way to find out more about the game and how to get the word out to collectors? I want to know if there is a way to determine the authenticity of it, if I have all the pieces, etc. It appears to be in decent shape given the age. Should I put it on eBay or is there a better marketplace for this type of stuff? Really any advice or information would be appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all, &lt;/p&gt;

I didn't want to have to go through and notify everyone that wanted to see more that I had taken pictures (sorry I don't have time to do that) so I thought I'd post an update with them. 

Thanks for all the replies on the previous thread encouraging me to take pictures. I opened it up and was instantly hit with the smell of my Great Grandmother's house that I spent so many days at growing up (mostly losing at Rummy to my grandmother). It really took me back and brought back a lot of fond memories. 

Anyways, without further ado [here are the pictures](http://imgur.com/a/pC0vIrX).
A few thoughts for anyone planning on buying this game. It feels really cheap, like if it were anyone but my GGM that had owned this copy I don't think it would have survived since the 80s. The yellow ink on the yellow mule cards is really hard to read, I imagine it was easier to read in the past but has faded over time. All in all I really like the box art of Columbia but to me the game feels like someone threw it together over a weekend to make some cash off of Mule Day. It's cheap enough that it's worth having if you're a fan of the holiday or just like really obscure games. I wouldn't play it though, just reading the instructions sounded like an even less fun Monopoly (although I could be wrong). 

I hope you all enjoy the pictures.  Thanks for reading. 

P.S. happy father's day to all the dad's that read this.

However I changed a few things

[This is my 4x3ft table](https://imgur.com/a/xRDTeyG)

1) I bought the 4x4 sheet of Plywood but had Home Depot cut it to 4x3ft. This allowed it to fit in my car and in future I could set two 4x3s beside each other on a larger table to have a 6x4 table top for larger games like 40k.

TIP: the XWing playmat is 36 1/2"" x 36 1/2"", so when getting the wood cut i asked him to be on the big side of 36"". So the plywood is about 48"" x 36 1/2"" and matches the playmat exactly.

2) I didn't want to bolt the wood to the table. And also because the table I have folds in half it has a raised crown in the center. So setting the plywood directly on the table meant it could rock side to side. So I filled those gaps with rubber shelf liner. So now the wood is both held nicely to the table and is also level. The whole thing feels solid and the wood isn't going to slide if you brush or lean against it.

It looks great wrapped in black felt. Will work perfectly for board games and other small miniatures games like Kill Team, and I wont have to hog the kitchen table and piss off the wife.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I followed this &lt;a href=""https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/205573-how-to-build-a-4-ft-x-4-ft-48-in-x-48-in-x-wing-miniature-gaming-table-for-under-60/""&gt;4x4ft table guide mostly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In short, here is how it works. When you construct a coal or iron mine, that mine starts off with ~4 resource cubes on it. Either you, or opponents may consume those cubes for free, in order to build other buildings. Once all cubes are consumed, the building flips, giving its owner income and VP.

Since resources are produced in batches, but consumed individually, trades are essentially asynchronous. It could well be to my benefit to put out a set of iron for you to use.

I'm Mattie Schraeder, a budding board game designer, blogger, web developer, and also a mod of the r/boardgames discord server!

For the past few years I've been working on my first game, [Walking Doggos](https://walkingdoggos.com). I often refer to it as a competitive version of Hanabi. It's essentially a trick taking game where you can't see the cards in your hand. Jamey Stegmaier recently talked about it in one of his [favorite game mechanism videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cII4e_-f4SM). You can find out more about the game on [https://walkingdoggos.com](https://walkingdoggos.com) \- it's available on [The Game Crafter](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/walking-doggos) and [DriveThruCards](https://www.drivethrucards.com/product/272507/Walking-Doggos), as well as free to play on [Tabletop Simulator](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1701859774).

Also in board game related work, about a year ago I joined as a board member for [Geekway to the West](https://geekwaytothewest.com), in charge of redesigning and maintaining their website. I helped plan and run Geekway Mini and Geekway 2019, where Walking Doggos was available on the play and win section!

My family played Jumanji for the first time last night and we need a verdict on what might be a loophole and how to resolve it. 

When you land on a blank space, the idea is that the other three players have to roll a rescue die until they all land on a certain symbol or until time runs out. If everyone succeeds, all players move forward. If one or more players fail, the person who lands on the blank space must move backwards. Ten failures throughout the game means all players lose. 

Obviously the spirit of the rule is to roll the rescue die as much as you can until the timer runs out, but can it be considered a legit strategy to roll as slowly as possible to try to get the player being rescued to move backwards? Our rules say they must ""keep rolling"" so does this mean there's a minimum of two rolls? 

Here's the Hasbro rules online. There's some different verbiage than our rules: https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Jumanji.PDF

Our rules. I included the ""jungle space"" rules bc they explicitly state the players must roll the dice ""as fast as they can,"" which isn't stated in the blank space rules: http://imgur.com/a/DF4V2nT

I would like to hear your opinions about this games. I'm a huge Lovecraft fan. I played EH and Pandemic Cthulhu. I really like the theme but the huge setup of EH makes me play less than I would like, also sometimes i feel like the game is playing me and not the other way around. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm aware that both games are very similar and story driven, one thing that i really like about boardgames is the replay value.  So do you guys think it's possible to play the same campaign multiple times and still be surprised? The cases are more in a branching way or more like EH where you draw  random cards to spice things up? Is there space for both games in a collection, or they overlap too much? I heard that AH is like EH but more streamlined due to the campaing, does this take away a little from the replay value?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not seeing as much hype for Arkham Horror as I was expecting, are people so invested in the LCG that they did not even gave a try for AH?

&amp;#x200B;

btw I believe I would be playing mostly at 2 people(do i need 2 core sets of LCG for that?). I really liked the customization aspect of EH where I would be building my character with items/skills/spells/ as the game progressed and the choices that i was given and seeing how things would play out","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello my fellow boardgamers!&lt;/p&gt;

This is a recap of all that has happened in /r/boardgames (and beyond!) in the last 4 weeks.

&amp;nbsp;

**The Top 3**

[Tariffs](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/bx53sj/trumps_tariffs_could_ruin_the_american_board_game/)

* If this happens you will hear about it for a long time. It could reshape the industry. [An industry expert weighs in](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/bphyo3/board_games_are_about_to_be_hit_with_a_25_tariff/).

[Stranger Things](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/bwc6p5/the_directors_of_avengers_endgame_are_adapting/)

* It looks like MTG is getting a netflix adaptation. I don't know how to feel about this.

[lol](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/bq5r82/new_board_game_uses_all_your_other_unopened_board/)

* Not gonna lie, I might buy this.

&amp;nbsp;

**You Might Have Missed...**

[The Passing of a Titan](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/bzd44v/james_mathe_owner_of_minion_games_and_cofounder/)

* James Mathe was one of unsung heroes of the tabletop world. His generosity of time and spirit are responsible for the success of an enormous number of modern games, designers, outlets, and publishers. I don't know a single person in the industry who hasn't been helped by James in their pursuit of bringing joy to the world through games. He will be missed.

[Digital Gloomhaven](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/bxluh6/gloomhaven_digital_first_gameplay_reveal_on_twitch/)

* Gloomhaven always felt more like a video game to me anyway, so this seems like a good fit.

&amp;nbsp;

**Best Discussion**

[Reboxing games](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/byd1mr/you_know_what_would_be_nice_a_simple_onepager/)

* All my big euros have boxes that are too small to fit custom storage solutions, and all my light games are filled with air.

&amp;nbsp;

**Tabletop Game Design: Thread of the Week**

[Cheese Dice](https://www.reddit.com/r/tabletopgamedesign/comments/bqe1qh/i_created_a_cheese_dice_a_half_hole_counts_as_one/)

* Made of real cheese. Ok, not really.

&amp;nbsp;

**Indie Kickstarter Spotlight**

[Wear reflective jackets](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/starluxgames/wizards-and-werewolves-a-glow-in-the-dark-outdoor-game)

* I had to share this. Its just such a unique concept.

&amp;nbsp;

The BGG database is enormous and getting bigger by the day. Chances are good that some of your favorite games never get mentioned here on /r/boardgames, even though they deserve to be.

Did you play a game for the first time this week that had never hit your radar, but just blew you away? Do you have a favorite childhood game that you think still holds up in today's modern board game scene? 

Is there a game you love so much that it will never leave your shelf, even if you'd never bring it to a meetup with strangers?

Now's your chance to embrace your inner Zee Garcia and talk up those niche titles that didn't get as much love as you thought they should.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BGG database is enormous and getting bigger by the day.

You can use &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template-no-explainer""&gt;this template&lt;/a&gt; to do so. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a version with explanations of what we&amp;#39;re looking for.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you reply to any comment that has a game name in &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt; with &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/r2d8""&gt;/u/r2d8&lt;/a&gt; getparentinfo&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;, one of our robots will tell you more about the game&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember that this is a community full of awesome, helpful people, and feel free to ask your questions whatever they may be. As always, keep it civil and remember what the downvote button is actually for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, here are some of the resources available at &lt;a href=""/r/boardgames""&gt;/r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

**Description from Boardgamegeek**:

The time has come for the selection of a new Chancellor at Argent University of Magic, and you are among the likely candidates for the job. Gather your apprentices, ready your spellbook, and build your influence, while secretly discovering and competing over the votes of a limited Consortium of influential board members. Only the one who is able to fulfill the most criteria will claim the title of most influential mage in the World of Indines!

Argent: The Consortium is a cutthroat worker-placement/engine-building game of manipulation and secrecy in which the criteria for victory are secret and the capabilities of your opponents are constantly changing. You'll need to outwit the other candidates, use your spells at the right moment, and choose the correct apprentices to manage your plan.

Argent: The Consortium is a European-style game that minimizes luck and focuses on player interaction and strong core mechanisms that allow new strategies to emerge each time you play.

The designer keeps an updated Official Errata/Typo/FAQ thread on BGG.

Personally, i just dusted off the Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone board game for old times sake. Now I realize why my mom never wanted to play it with me. As much as I love Harry potter this is one of the most egregious examples of a cash grab I have ever seen.[ This is it.](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13447/harry-potter-and-sorcerers-stone-game) 

For those of you unfamiliar it is not actually a game, but 6 and 3/4s games which are meant to represent the challenges guarding the stone. Cool concept. Terrible execution. 

Major problems I noticed. 

1) Multiple of the games consisted of rolling dice or spinning a spinner and moving around. Very candy land esq, but with out the advantage of being for toddlers. 

2) some Might add a couple problems to slow people down, but these can easily be rolled right past and never triggered.

3) the game had rules for people to advance between challenges. Separating the players. But multiple of the challanges assumed that players would arrive at them concurrently in design for example

4) the chess portion was chess, except the added rule that the character token replaces a bishop and has to get across the board. But if another player hasn't arrived, no one controls the opposing color and you can essentially just skirt across un hindered. 

5) the last game (or 3/4s of a game) is literally just drawing cards until someone draws the right card.

6) there were multiple tokens that had absolutely no in game effects.

7) the boards are meant to fit together but never sit right.

8) two games require a spinner. But they only give you one, which is reversible. But players can get stuck in the at the two games that require the spinner. So you have yo CONSTANTLY flip the thing over, pull out the spinner bit and reverse it.

9) the second to last challenge game is moderately complicated. Which is fine, except the rules as written for it are extrodinarily confusing.

Basically the system in question, which I'm sure is used in plenty of other games as well, is that instead of a VP track where players place their disc on to indicate how many points they have, players accumulate VP tokens. The tokens themselves are double-sided.

I really dislike that kind of VP scoring system, but maybe it's because I don't understand its value, so if anyone can explain what the merits of such a system are, maybe I'll get around and appreciate it...?

What I don't like is that first, it's impossible to hide from the other players (Glen More rules even states the points should be hidden to the other players.). They are double-sided, so you at least know what the token on top of a pile is. Besides that, you can literally see the height of the pile, so if you've been keeping up with the game, you can approximate how much points other players have.

Secondly, if the goal is to make it hard for other players to evaluate exactly how many points you have, anyone with a very good memory or someone who writes down other player's points on a piece of paper, will have an advantage over other players. I mean if the point is to hide information from other players, there are way better tools for the job, that means the designer specifically chose to uses that particular method for a purpose.

So I'm quite perplexed on this point system, why use it all?

*How long have you been collecting?*   
As stated in the title, I've been collecting since I was thirteen and I'm just about to turn nineteen! Back when I was just a wee little laddie, I stumbled upon the Game Grumps playing a game called **Betrayal at House on the Hill** and was immediately fascinated (given up to that point, my definition of board games was very strictly casual stuff with a bit of **Munchkin** thrown in). A few months later, Christmas arrived, and I was blessed with the game! I'm pretty certain my first few plays were abhorrently erred rules-wise, but I quickly found myself enamored with it.  


*What would you change about your collection, if any?*  
Right now, I'm mainly a bit dissatisfied with a few games I rarely get the chance to play, if at all. Highlights in that are **Ticket to Ride**, **King of Tokyo**, **Carcassone**, the OG **Betrayal**, and some that I just in general pick up less. All of them served me really well in the early days of hobby-discovering, but it feels like there's no reason to keep around the family-oriented games when others have solidly replaced them. Still trying to find a good way to gift those or resell them without just trashing.


*What are your favorite games in your collection?*  
Ah, the impossible question. Really, it depends on the day, and there's so many highlights. For more casual parties, **Bang: The Dice Game!**, **Cockroach Poker**, **Coup** (with the Reformation expansion) and **Deception: Murder in Hong Kong** are all smash hits that play really well with bigger groups. **Just One** is quickly approaching this for me too, but I got that more recently. If we're talking more involved smaller groups, **Clank!, Modern Art, Cosmic Encounter,** and **Alchemists** I'm really fond of - I love the table talk that generates from all of these games. I wouldn't be surprised if both **Chronicles of Crime** and **Pandemic Legacy: Season 1** end up in this pile, but I've gotten those two recently and have only played each once.  


*Shelf of Shame?*  
I'm very proud of how much I keep up trying to play all of my games. I try to make orders once every two months, and just recently I got a chunk in, meaning my shelf of shame is a bit bigger. **The Resistance: Avalon**, **Lords of Xidit**, **Dice Forge**, and **Fury of Dracula** all came in recently and I'm definitely planning on ticking a few of those up come this saturday (when my group meets up), and I haven't gotten a chance to bust out **Fog of Love**, **Insider**, or **A Fake Artist Goes to New York**.   


*What's Next?*  
**Azul** is coming in right now. After playing Chronicles of Crime, I'm thinking about both **Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective** and **Detective: A Modern Crime Board Game**. Other various ones floating around in my ""to buy next"" are **Quacks of Quedlinburg**, **Chinatown**, **Diamant**, and **Root**.

Still trying to find a good way to gift those or resell them without just trashing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are your favorite games in your collection?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Ah, the impossible question. Really, it depends on the day, and there&amp;#39;s so many highlights. For more casual parties, &lt;strong&gt;Bang: The Dice Game!&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Cockroach Poker&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Coup&lt;/strong&gt; (with the Reformation expansion) and &lt;strong&gt;Deception: Murder in Hong Kong&lt;/strong&gt; are all smash hits that play really well with bigger groups. &lt;strong&gt;Just One&lt;/strong&gt; is quickly approaching this for me too, but I got that more recently. If we&amp;#39;re talking more involved smaller groups, &lt;strong&gt;Clank!, Modern Art, Cosmic Encounter,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Alchemists&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m really fond of - I love the table talk that generates from all of these games. I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if both &lt;strong&gt;Chronicles of Crime&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Pandemic Legacy: Season 1&lt;/strong&gt; end up in this pile, but I&amp;#39;ve gotten those two recently and have only played each once.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shelf of Shame?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;#39;m very proud of how much I keep up trying to play all of my games. I try to make orders once every two months, and just recently I got a chunk in, meaning my shelf of shame is a bit bigger. &lt;strong&gt;The Resistance: Avalon&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lords of Xidit&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Dice Forge&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Fury of Dracula&lt;/strong&gt; all came in recently and I&amp;#39;m definitely planning on ticking a few of those up come this saturday (when my group meets up), and I haven&amp;#39;t gotten a chance to bust out &lt;strong&gt;Fog of Love&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Insider&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;A Fake Artist Goes to New York&lt;/strong&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What&amp;#39;s Next?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Azul&lt;/strong&gt; is coming in right now. After playing Chronicles of Crime, I&amp;#39;m thinking about both &lt;strong&gt;Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Detective: A Modern Crime Board Game&lt;/strong&gt;. Other various ones floating around in my &amp;quot;to buy next&amp;quot; are &lt;strong&gt;Quacks of Quedlinburg&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Chinatown&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Diamant&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Root&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

There was talk that it was themeless, that the graphic design was so bad it made the game unplayable and it wasn’t very fun.

Well, firstly - the design has changed since Essen when it first came out. There is much less black, things have been tidied up and something brightened to make it easier to see. I found everything to be very functional apart from 2 of the scout tiles are very close in colour it’s hard to tell in low light. My girlfriends first reaction was it was ugly. I sort of agreed at first, but as we played and afterwards I didn’t mind and it’s grown on me a lot. I understand the developers have taken on the initial criticism about the design and improved it - which I think is great. One thing I liked personally, was it shared a lot with GWT so that I didn’t need to learn much. Once you understood a couple of new icons, it all made sense quickly. 

Theme wise - I think many people are right but this is going to be a very much what you make of it situation. There is little to no acknowledgment of the theme in the rules book (apart from the story mode at the end) so you really have to make your own fun here. I think it’s all there - but the rules focus almost solely on the mechanic of the game. I think GWT was guilty of that too - but GWT also looks a lot nicer and is generally more appealing for us that it was easier to enjoy the game. With BHK I think it really is make or break if you actually have fun playing the game....

I found this really fun and really satisfying to play. I went in ready to quit halfway through or to at least have to push on to the end - but every step in the game had interesting decisions and they flowed really well. One great aspect for us here was that we could do lots of it simultaneously (we both get impatient) but there was enough where we had to wait for each other so we didn’t just rush to the end of the turn. Yes, interaction is very low here but towards the end of the game it started to creep in more and more. As we both wanted specific objectives, as we both wanted new unseen scouting tiles, as we both wanted specific scouting areas. It wasn’t super tense because it didn’t matter hugely if either of us got something - but I found myself paying more and more attention to her decisions than I was expecting too.

My favourite aspect here are the steps and how they are set out. Yes, I think setting them on the player board does distract from the theme - I think I makes it less immersive if you are told to buy new objectives and refresh your hand. But anyway, I really felt each one presented me with an interesting choice using different mechanics, that flowed into the next using other mechanics. The round starts of with some hand management, then some resource management, then some set collection, then some area control (although very light) and some route building and then back to some hand management and towards the end of the game some engine building. I really liked this - I was playing lots of different mechanics all within the same turn and they all mattered to each other. 

Anyway, just had to get this off my chest. Went in being told how just average the game was but enough people I usually agree with to really, really liking it.

It was made locally in Columbia TN by Fiddle Diddle Inc. They appear to be out of business. There's no year marked on it I can find but I imagine it's from the 80s or later.

Edit: found some info on the company, it was founded in 86 and went inactive a year later so the game is about 32 years old. 

Looks like a monopoly style game. 

If someone wants to see more pictures I can provide. It's still in pretty good shape. I think some of the money is missing because there are considerably less 5s compared to the others.

&lt;p&gt;It was made locally in Columbia TN by Fiddle Diddle Inc. They appear to be out of business. There&amp;#39;s no year marked on it I can find but I imagine it&amp;#39;s from the 80s or later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: found some info on the company, it was founded in 86 and went inactive a year later so the game is about 32 years old. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like a monopoly style game. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone wants to see more pictures I can provide. It&amp;#39;s still in pretty good shape. I think some of the money is missing because there are considerably less 5s compared to the others.&lt;/p&gt;

The entire game essentially boils down to two components: deciding cube placement, and how these cubes/buildings score. Both of these components are done in the worst possible way.

The most rewarding aspect of this game is completing a cube pattern and getting a building down. Problem is, building that structure feels hollow, and there’s two key reasons it’s a joyless task. One, there’s no instant gratification. There’s nothing that helps you build other buildings easier or faster, and you don’t immediately score any points for it. You’re just tucking away in the back of your head that you did a good thing and you’ll get to see the fruits of your labor later when your friend is scribbling scores down. But the other problem is that you might not have scored any points at all for that building. Either you need to build other buildings for it to be fully realized, or even worse, you might’ve scored negative points for it by the end of the game.

Besides the lack of positive emotional feedback, what TT fails to deliver on is one of the cardinal requirements of a good board game: a sense of agency. You need to feel like your decisions are your own, that they matter, and that you’re informed enough to make them. The issue is the amount of randomness present in the game versus the decision space provided. You get exactly one random input (a resource), and you have 16 things you can do with it (put it on an empty space). On the next turn, you’ve already filled up one of the spaces, so you only have 15 things you can do with your next resource. And so on and so forth, until your clock runs down to zero things you can do.

This is even before considering that your actual, realistic choices are much more limited than previously described, since anybody who’s played more than once wouldn’t put cubes intended to be used for different buildings next to each other, or build in the center early, or put impossible combinations next to each other. If you’re playing with even a modicum of skill, the decision space shrinks from “not a lot of choices” to “maybe one or two.” Before you’re halfway through the game, your board is filled enough that the game is using you to play it. 

This lack of decision space is exacerbated by the fact that the play experience as a whole runs emotionally counter to what you want in any media: start simple and let the consumer get acclimated, then raise the complexity and intensity until they approach the end and reach a climax. In TT, you start with the largest decision space and only reduce the complexity until the end is near, where you can see your demise several turns ahead of time and allow yourself to check out completely.

I haven’t yet talked about the most exciting part of the game, where every few turns you don’t just put a cube down, but you get to declare which of the five colors that cube is first. Yes, this offers significantly more choices; even if you only have ten spaces available to you, that’s 50 possibilities. Excellent! So depending on the number of players, you have a turn where you get to make an actual decision somewhere between 17% and 50% of the time.That’s assuming you aren’t using your turn to obviously complete a building, which you probably are, making even this turn one that plays itself. It’s just not enough to feel the previously mentioned sense of agency, which neatly summarizes half of the game’s problems. That leaves the other half to scoring.

“Buildings scoring based on proximity to other buildings” is a mechanic I don’t think has a name yet, and I’m hoping it’s never popular enough to get one. Tiny Towns, Suburbia, Castles of Mad King Ludwig, Between Two Cities, and Ora et Labora all fall into this category, and they’re all much worse for it. There’s two core issues with this mechanic that show up in varying levels depending on the game: (once again) the lack of agency, and the inherently swingy nature of the scoring.

Having beat decision space to death, I’ll try to keep the lack of agency part of scoring short. Whenever you’re given two buildings that shouldn’t be next to each other, you keep them apart. When you’re given two buildings that should be next to each other, you keep them together. That’s it. That’s all the decision making power you have. You’re playing “Third Grade Seating Charts: The Game.” 

What happens when, especially in TT, you have no choice and you end up having to put a building somewhere that you didn’t want it to go? Or even worse, circumstance means you didn’t finish that last building at all? Well, what it means is you could’ve gone from first to last because somebody decided they wanted to a yellow cube instead of a red one. That’s because this building is worth 3 points, but only if you put that building next to it, which is also worth 3 points. Without both, you get zero. Assuming it’s the difference between 24 and 30 points, you just lost (or gained) 20% of your points on the last turn due to dumb luck. And honestly, even if it were due to user error, that’s a huge swing for what amounts to one minor mistake.

Even better, let’s say I’ve built 5 Almshouses, for -5 points, and then build one more, and it flips to +26. That easily takes me from last place to first. The thing is, nobody’s paying attention to anybody else’s boards, you don’t have enough future information to base your decisions on anyway. If everybody’s attempting to analyze everybody’s board in order to hate draft cubes, the game’s going to take years, because you have to re-evaluate the game state from scratch every single turn. So nobody’s going to pay attention to the fact that I have 5 Almshouses and a 6th would be devastating, making my success or failure a product of luck.

What I haven’t mention is that I’m not going to be able to get 6 Almshouses up unless everybody else is going for them anyway. The way the game is set up, you’re encouraged to follow the other players’ strategies. Note that since everybody has a unique building nobody will have an identical board, but trying to zag when everybody else zigs is going to burn you in TT. That’s because you’re going for gray and blue cubes while they’re primarily going for red, brown, and yellow cubes. So they’re all helping each other and hurting you with cubes you don’t want, and you only get the cubes you want when it’s your turn. That’s not nearly enough for you to win, so you’re relegated to following their strategy. Once again, this proves you have to do what the game is telling you to do rather than making unique or interesting choices for yourself.

If cube laying and scoring were the only issues with this game, I’d never touch it again anyway, but there’s a few truly awful design choices beyond those that are worth discussion. For one, there’s something that you can either call player elimination or the equivalent of the “lose a turn” mechanic. If you’ve filled up your board first, everybody else is going to keep playing until they’ve also filled their boards. It’s technically not player elimination because you could definitely still win, but you’re sitting around bored while everybody else is still playing this game. Some would argue the game is short enough that it’s no big deal. No, that’s apologist garbage for bad game design. This is a light game with strategy a 4-year-old could master, and having any turn where a player does nothing is unacceptable. 

TT has the potential to be a wildly different game with 2 players than with 6 players because there are zero rule differences to compensate for player count. Claiming this is a 6-player game is a bald-faced lie - at that point you might as well close your eyes and chuck the cubes wherever, then throw away the boards and roll a die to determine the winner. If the game is best with the degree of randomness provided at 4 players, it’s necessary for the game to ensure all player counts retain that feel. Throwing alternate rules into the box doesn’t count as fixing the problem, but it does count as bad game design trying to hedge its bets.

Lastly, a relatively minor quibble, this is next in a long line of games that requires you to tally up scores at the end. There are eight different buildings to score per person, so depending on player count, the end game tallying process can take several minutes. That’s not unreasonable for a game you’ve been playing for two or three hours. For a 20 or 30 minute game, that’s just absurd. You end up spending 10% of your playtime doing addition or watching your friends do addition.

If you want a game that involves barely more skill than Killer Bunnies, but does a much better job than Killer Bunnies of convincing most people of the grand illusion that their choices matter, get this game. If you want a game where you mindlessly put cubes on a board and every once in a while get to pat yourself on the back and think, “Yay, the cubes made a building!” before zonking out until the next completed color pattern, get this game. If you played Castles of Mad King Ludwig and said to yourself, “You know, I love the master builder and the lousy scoring system, but I wish it were idiot simple, totally unpredictable, and played three times faster,” get this game. Under no other circumstances should anybody have Tiny Towns in their collection.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, Tiny Towns is a game where each turn you put one colored cube down on your personal board, eventually turning those cubes into buildings, whose placement relative to each other will score varying points.

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t yet talked about the most exciting part of the game, where every few turns you don’t just put a cube down, but you get to declare which of the five colors that cube is first. Yes, this offers significantly more choices; even if you only have ten spaces available to you, that’s 50 possibilities. Excellent! So depending on the number of players, you have a turn where you get to make an actual decision somewhere between 17% and 50% of the time.That’s assuming you aren’t using your turn to obviously complete a building, which you probably are, making even this turn one that plays itself. It’s just not enough to feel the previously mentioned sense of agency, which neatly summarizes half of the game’s problems. That leaves the other half to scoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Buildings scoring based on proximity to other buildings” is a mechanic I don’t think has a name yet, and I’m hoping it’s never popular enough to get one. Tiny Towns, Suburbia, Castles of Mad King Ludwig, Between Two Cities, and Ora et Labora all fall into this category, and they’re all much worse for it. There’s two core issues with this mechanic that show up in varying levels depending on the game: (once again) the lack of agency, and the inherently swingy nature of the scoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having beat decision space to death, I’ll try to keep the lack of agency part of scoring short. Whenever you’re given two buildings that shouldn’t be next to each other, you keep them apart. When you’re given two buildings that should be next to each other, you keep them together. That’s it. That’s all the decision making power you have. You’re playing “Third Grade Seating Charts: The Game.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens when, especially in TT, you have no choice and you end up having to put a building somewhere that you didn’t want it to go? Or even worse, circumstance means you didn’t finish that last building at all? Well, what it means is you could’ve gone from first to last because somebody decided they wanted to a yellow cube instead of a red one. That’s because this building is worth 3 points, but only if you put that building next to it, which is also worth 3 points. Without both, you get zero. Assuming it’s the difference between 24 and 30 points, you just lost (or gained) 20% of your points on the last turn due to dumb luck. And honestly, even if it were due to user error, that’s a huge swing for what amounts to one minor mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even better, let’s say I’ve built 5 Almshouses, for -5 points, and then build one more, and it flips to +26. That easily takes me from last place to first. The thing is, nobody’s paying attention to anybody else’s boards, you don’t have enough future information to base your decisions on anyway. If everybody’s attempting to analyze everybody’s board in order to hate draft cubes, the game’s going to take years, because you have to re-evaluate the game state from scratch every single turn. So nobody’s going to pay attention to the fact that I have 5 Almshouses and a 6th would be devastating, making my success or failure a product of luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I haven’t mention is that I’m not going to be able to get 6 Almshouses up unless everybody else is going for them anyway. The way the game is set up, you’re encouraged to follow the other players’ strategies. Note that since everybody has a unique building nobody will have an identical board, but trying to zag when everybody else zigs is going to burn you in TT. That’s because you’re going for gray and blue cubes while they’re primarily going for red, brown, and yellow cubes. So they’re all helping each other and hurting you with cubes you don’t want, and you only get the cubes you want when it’s your turn. That’s not nearly enough for you to win, so you’re relegated to following their strategy. Once again, this proves you have to do what the game is telling you to do rather than making unique or interesting choices for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If cube laying and scoring were the only issues with this game, I’d never touch it again anyway, but there’s a few truly awful design choices beyond those that are worth discussion. For one, there’s something that you can either call player elimination or the equivalent of the “lose a turn” mechanic. If you’ve filled up your board first, everybody else is going to keep playing until they’ve also filled their boards. It’s technically not player elimination because you could definitely still win, but you’re sitting around bored while everybody else is still playing this game. Some would argue the game is short enough that it’s no big deal. No, that’s apologist garbage for bad game design. This is a light game with strategy a 4-year-old could master, and having any turn where a player does nothing is unacceptable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TT has the potential to be a wildly different game with 2 players than with 6 players because there are zero rule differences to compensate for player count. Claiming this is a 6-player game is a bald-faced lie - at that point you might as well close your eyes and chuck the cubes wherever, then throw away the boards and roll a die to determine the winner. If the game is best with the degree of randomness provided at 4 players, it’s necessary for the game to ensure all player counts retain that feel. Throwing alternate rules into the box doesn’t count as fixing the problem, but it does count as bad game design trying to hedge its bets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, a relatively minor quibble, this is next in a long line of games that requires you to tally up scores at the end. There are eight different buildings to score per person, so depending on player count, the end game tallying process can take several minutes. That’s not unreasonable for a game you’ve been playing for two or three hours. For a 20 or 30 minute game, that’s just absurd. You end up spending 10% of your playtime doing addition or watching your friends do addition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want a game that involves barely more skill than Killer Bunnies, but does a much better job than Killer Bunnies of convincing most people of the grand illusion that their choices matter, get this game. If you want a game where you mindlessly put cubes on a board and every once in a while get to pat yourself on the back and think, “Yay, the cubes made a building!” before zonking out until the next completed color pattern, get this game. If you played Castles of Mad King Ludwig and said to yourself, “You know, I love the master builder and the lousy scoring system, but I wish it were idiot simple, totally unpredictable, and played three times faster,” get this game. Under no other circumstances should anybody have Tiny Towns in their collection.&lt;/p&gt;

My shelving is all in my nook where I keep my books which seems to work for now.  

My favorite game at the moment is Terraforming Mars.  The expansions are really great but still need to try Venus Next.  It’s also my favorite game to play solo.  

Wingspan, Evolution: Climate and Arkham Horror have been a blast as well.  However, I don’t get a whole lot of playing time as I am still looking for a group to play with. 

Not shown are some of the family games I play with the wife and kids.  Games like Kingdomino (with Age of Giants expansion), 5 Minute Marvel, Icecool, Trash Pandas, etc.   

The list of games I still want to play is a long one but the main ones I think I will like are Clank!, Deception, Architects of the West Kingdom, 51st State, Suburbia, This War of Mine and Viticulture.  I also have the digital versions of Patchwork, Onitama, and Galaxy Trucker.  I definitely want to purchase Onitama and possibly Deep Sea Adventures to play with the kids.

**How to Play:**

A set of letters will be publicly be made available for the participants. Players will then commit in this thread 1 to 4 letters they will be committed to using for the turn. A game consists of 3 rounds, 3 turns each. Players gain 1 point for each letter they commit to. Once all letter commitments are in, players will then DM me two words, their **robber word**, and their **cop word**. Your cop word does NOT have to adhere to your letter commitments, but your robber word does. The robber word is the word you're trying to make unique, and the cop word is the word you think other people are going to pick based on their letter commitments. If your robber word is the same as another robber's word, you bust and receive no points for the turn. If your cop word busts a robber word, they receive no points for the turn and you receive their points instead. The same letters are used all three turns in a round, and players CANNOT reuse words, so the playing field gets harder and harder.

**Henchmen and Bonus Letters:**

In addition to gaining points from committing letters, there will be two bonus letters that award you +1/+2 respectively each time you include them in your word. There also two Henchmen a round that provide additional points for your word if you satisfy their conditions. For example, Lil Becky awards you +2 for your word if you can make it exactly 3 letters long, or there's Slim Jim who awards you +1 if you can manage to make your word only one syllable.

**Word Creation Rules:**

* No two-letter words
* No proper nouns
* You cannot use the same letter twice UNLESS you have committed to that letter twice.

# Round 1 Turn 1

*Henchmen 1*: Fabio the ""Tough Guy"": Your word must be at least 4 letters long (+1)

*Henchmen 2*: Tim the ""Fatman"": Your word must be exactly 2 syllables (+2)

I'm going on a trip in a few weeks and wanted to bring a few card games with me as potential stuff to play in the hotel room, at dinner, bars, etc. if we end up hanging out as a group or with friends. 

I was debating the other day between **Skull** and **Cockroach Poker**, but I've seen a lot of people say you can easily 'make' a copy of **Skull** using a regular deck of 52 cards. 

This got me thinking: would I be able to make **Skull** using **Cockroach Poker Royal**, using the Royal cards for Skulls? Would there be any issues? I guess it would only play 4, right? I'm not really sure how many people I'll potentially end up with, but I think the Asmodee version of **Skull** only plays 6(?) but would require me to carry 2 games rather than one. Would I be better off making Skull out of a set of playing cards and also carrying along **Cockroach Poker?**

I also had a small question: is **Cockroach Poker** the best overall 'gross animal' game? It seems the simplest, but I know people have said **Cheating Bee/Moth** are quite fun too, as well as **Cockroach Salad**. Which would you suggest is the easiest to teach and play quickly?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was debating the other day between &lt;strong&gt;Skull&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Cockroach Poker&lt;/strong&gt;, but I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of people say you can easily &amp;#39;make&amp;#39; a copy of &lt;strong&gt;Skull&lt;/strong&gt; using a regular deck of 52 cards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This got me thinking: would I be able to make &lt;strong&gt;Skull&lt;/strong&gt; using &lt;strong&gt;Cockroach Poker Royal&lt;/strong&gt;, using the Royal cards for Skulls? Would there be any issues? I guess it would only play 4, right? I&amp;#39;m not really sure how many people I&amp;#39;ll potentially end up with, but I think the Asmodee version of &lt;strong&gt;Skull&lt;/strong&gt; only plays 6(?) but would require me to carry 2 games rather than one. Would I be better off making Skull out of a set of playing cards and also carrying along &lt;strong&gt;Cockroach Poker?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had a small question: is &lt;strong&gt;Cockroach Poker&lt;/strong&gt; the best overall &amp;#39;gross animal&amp;#39; game? It seems the simplest, but I know people have said &lt;strong&gt;Cheating Bee/Moth&lt;/strong&gt; are quite fun too, as well as &lt;strong&gt;Cockroach Salad&lt;/strong&gt;. Which would you suggest is the easiest to teach and play quickly?&lt;/p&gt;

Not only has he created a lasting legacy as the designer of the worker placement hit Agricola, along with a string of other strategy games, but recent years have seen him produce a string of very popular Tetris-style tile laying games. First came Patchwork[ ](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/163412/patchwork)(2014), which is an excellent two player game that requires players to build a patchwork on their personal 9x9 board. Following this success, Rosenberg went on to create a tile-laying trilogy of multi-player games, with Cottage Garden[ ](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/204027/cottage-garden)(2016), [I](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/233678/indian-summer)ndian Summer (2017), and finally [**Spring Meadow**](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/253684/spring-meadow) (2018), all of which have been brought to the English market by Stronghold Games.  Spring Meadow promises to be the best of the bunch yet, with a streamlined style of game-play that gives ample scope for strategic play, making it enjoyable both as a filler or as a family game. 

**GAME-PLAY**

Now that it's spring, along with our fellow players we find ourselves in a meadow. It's our job to select meadow tiles from a central supply, carefully planning our choices, to try to fill our personal mountain board using a tetris-style tile placement. Many tiles have holes in them, which we can use to receive bonuses by careful placement. For extra interest, there are marmot burrows to contend with as well. We will certainly all enjoy our spring walk, but will we be the player who is first in the race to get two hiking pins? 

**IMPRESSIONS**

Like the other entries in the series, the game-play has a strong feeling of being a Tetris-style puzzle.  In terms of complexity, the rules are very straight-forward, making it the easiest of Rosenberg's tile-laying trilogy.  Yet considering the relatively simple game-play, there's considerable strategy in how the game plays.  Strategy is especially necessary in planning your tile selection carefully based on which tiles are coming up.  Another important strategic consideration is optimizing how you use the holes that are in individual tile pieces.  The game-play also has elements of a racing game, since the goal is to be the first player to win two scoring rounds.  It plays very quickly, and is the shortest of the series, while the pleasant artwork and theme also enhance the family-friendly feel.  These elements give it the perfect qualities for a filler game and make it well suited for non-gamers and families

Spring Meadow is a welcome successor to Cottage Garden and Indian Summer, and of course Patchwork.  If you enjoy the Tetris-style game play of these puzzle games there is enough that's different about all of these games to make each of them worth owning and playing. They do share similar mechanics, but each game has a very different theme and there are enough differences in the game engine that players who enjoy one will tend to enjoy them all. 

**RECOMMENDATION**

Comparing all the games in his tile trilogy, Uwe Rosenberg has probably put things together best in **Spring Meadow**. The game rules are more streamlined, and the game-play is more simple and speedy, and yet there are strategic choices where good planning is rewarded. As with all the games, the component and artwork is very pretty and adds charm, while the gameplay is accessible for families and non-gamers, while gamers can still appreciate it as a lighter style of game. Spring Meadow avoids some of the complexity found in Cottage Garden, and while Indian Summer may have the prettiest components of the bunch, the smooth gameplay of Spring Meadow is probably where things shine best.

Once again Uwe Rosenberg has created another game that not only looks beautiful, but plays well. It will be heartily welcomed by fans of the previous games in this series, and recommends itself as an excellent family game, and an ideal introduction to those unfamiliar with these tile-laying puzzle and tetris-style games.

This post stems from a new game I just saw in my FLGS called Secret Weapons of the Third Reich. Players take the perspective of Nazi scientists trying to create real weapons used in WW2 like the V1 and V2 bombs, and new futuristic weapons like flying saucers. Part of the game even revolves around trying to win the favor of Heinrich Himmler.

I did not play, but from reading the rules and the box art and descriptions, the game seems to be going for a ""Oh those silly Nazis and their craaaazy weapons!"" vibe. It seemed to do little to rectify the literal crimes against humanity committed by the Nazi party and the scientists complicit and responsible for them.

I understand games are a medium for story and history. This War of Mine comes to mind, and I know there are games about the Underground Railroad. These games seem more to force players to confront atrocities in our shared history and spark discussion through play. I think that is a great directions for games to take, but worry about these topics being mishandled.

**How long have you been involved in the hobby?**

I've liked boardgames for most of my life but only got serious about collecting and playing regularly this year.

**What would you change about your collection if you could?**

I'd like to get some more euro-games into my collection.  Right now I've only really got Concordia, and I guess some would say Pandemic, I'm not really sure.  I'm keeping an eye out for Tigris and Euphrates, Orleans and Terra Mystica.

**Most expensive game?**

Blood on the Clocktower which isn't actually pictured here because it's a kickstarter which hasn't shipped yet.  Most I spent on a pictured game is probably Spirit Island.

**Most played game?**

I've probably played more Wizard than anything else to be honest. I've loved that game for years and it's small and easy to take anywhere.

**Favourite Game?**

Pandemic Legacy Season 1. It was an amazingly tense campaign and I'm not sure when I'll ever get an experience like that again. Season 2 was also excellent but didn't quite stack up to it's predecessor imo.

**Favourite designer?**

I haven't played anything by Vlaada Chvátil that was less than excellent.

**Wanted games?**

Aside from above, I want to get Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective to play with the wife, Captain Sonar for bigger parties, Gloomhaven when I find a stable group who can play it regularly and Letters From Whitechapel just because I think hidden movement games are neat.

**How did you acquire your games?**

9 bought second hand, 7 bought at brick-and-mortar, 10 bought online, 1 gift.

EDIT: Forgot to mention I built the bookshelf specifically to hold my collection.  Not super relevant but I'm proud of it and wanted to brag.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/Qu3aA59""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/Qu3aA59&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It seemed very complex, and we had a huge group (10?). But boy oh boy, did it turn out great. Anyone who likes Hidden werewolf, or Ultimate werewolf, or whatever it's called would probably love this. 

Secret Hitler is a subterfuge game similar to Hidden Werewolf, except with a few more rules, that (imo) make it more fun/competetive/easier to invest in. Basically, there are Liberals and Fascists, and each side is trying to win. Liberals win by passing 5 liberal ""policies"" (just tokens gained by a certain set of circumstances), or killing Hitler. Fascists win by selecting Hitler as Chancellor, or passing 6 fascist ""policies."" Hitler is a fascist, but does not know the other fascists. The other fascists know each other and Hitler. None of the liberals know anything. So thats the premise. Game time is roughly an hour. There are only 11 policies and one policy basically has to get passed per turn, unless theres a veto, which is more of a late late game thing. 

So just some brief background on our experience, which I will share below because I think its hilarious- our friends are all extremely Type A, and very competitive. One, ""Jack,"" is hilariously intense when it comes to games, and theres no check on his manicness, lmfao. Hes just (understandably imo) obsessed with the rules, but also insanely competitive and a sore loser to boot. He sounds really annoying, but I actually really enjoy him because hes really nice. Just super intense. He also wins a lot, and is a control freak, so I think a lot of his intensity comes from some mild, uncontrolled anxiety.

So anyway, we start the game, and it's kinda slow. Everyone's suspicious of everyone (except the Fascists- Me, my fiancee, and another guy named ""Brett"", and chick named ""Beth"" was Hitler. Of note, we were all sitting next to each other, its just how the cards were dealt), and the first couple of turns are kinda slow. Then, its Jack's turn to be president, which moves clockwise every new turn (and I'm sitting next to him, so I'm after him). One fascist policy has already been passed, which means the president (president selects the chancellor) gets to look at one persons party affiliation. He looks at mine. Sees that I'm fascist. Hes liberal. He immediately tells everyone that I'm fascist, while I, of course, deny deny deny, and deflect as I scramble for a way out of this very early mess. Jack is already making a scene at this point btw. Loud, and very emphatic. The game is heating up. 

Then, it's my turn. Oh shit, wait, I can look at a card too. How can I salvage this situation? By looking at **his card!** I'm already acting indignant af, and so I flip it back on him. He. Went. Ballistic. It was **epic.** I looked at his card, saw the fear in his eyes, and basically was like ""ohhhh, that explains why hes so eager to make it seem like I'M a fascist- JACKS a freaking fascist!!"" He immediately begins panicking and having a meltdown, and the room devolves into chaos. Nobody can decide who to believe, or if it even matters at this point early in the game, and for me, I'm playing it cool as a cucumber. Just sticking to my very simple story. 

People aren't paying attention. I lean over to Jack, beckoning him closer. He leans in. I whisper, ""Even by leaning over, you're incriminating yourself, and no ones ever going to believe you, motherfucker."" Boom. That was the button. Jack goes full panic mode and starts desperately trying to explain extremely loudly via various attempts at logic and reasoning, how it's clear that I'm a fascist. But people saw us talking. So, they either think were *both* fascists (~50%), or Jack is (~50%), because hes acting so freaking insane. And this is compounded by me calmly reiterating over and over that **his** card was the fascist one, while he goes ballistic beside me. 

The game goes on. He gets up on his soapbox every. Single. Turn. He looks crazier and crazier, and more and more desperate, lmao. All the while I'm just subtly stoking the fire and gaslighting the shit out of him publicly. Public opinion shifts. Hes desperately trying to convince them to change to a strategy that 100% would have worked, but nobody trusted him and they began to trust me. 

One of the fascist powers later in the game is that the president (regardless of political party) gets to kill someone. I already convinced them to kill ""Tina"" (a liberal), and Jack has been acting **INSANE** (because hes ""innocent,"" and being accused of and treated like hes guilty, BY SOMEONE WHO IS GUILTY, and the entire group is buying it). I convince the group to kill Jack, because hes obviously fascist, so theres a one in four chance hes Hitler, and ""we"" would win. **JACK GETS EXECUTED FOR HIS TREASON** (people who are out can not reveal their party or any relevant info). The threat is gone. 

We still actually ended up losing because Brett gave himself away, but hot damn man, before that happened, we managed to secretly kill *TWO* of the six liberals, and came so close to getting Beth voted chancellor (the only reason it didnt worl is because Brett voted yes instead of no, which gave away our intentions and lost us the game). We played it perfectly, and it. Was. Hilarious. Jack made such a scene, and I've been laughing about it for two days. 

And then there are little deceptions too, that have me retrospectively so weak. For example, we (the fascists) noticed that the liberals were clapping every time they passed a liberal policy, so about halfway through the game, we all started clapping every time a liberal policy was passed, lmfaoooo. It was somehow just hilarious, because you look, **and feel,** wayyyyyy dumber than you'd think fake clapping for something like that, lmao. And my fiancee and Beth and I (Beth figured out the other fascists very fast) were super in sync, and really working as a team to sowe dissent and divide the liberals from within, and we actually managed to pass **FIVE** fascist policies (which is like, egregiously obvious) by using twisted logic (like, we need to kill Jack, he could be Hitler, etc) and deception. The *only* reason we lost is because Brett gave himself away early, and then sort of checked out and didnt care about the ensuing results, which fucked us when he gave us away on his vote. 

It was a freaking riot, man. 10/10 would absolutely play again. Way better than the werewolf game, imo, which I like but started to get tired of because there doesnt seem to be any real point to the game other than just repeatedly playing short rounds.

You guys should def get this game if you can, especially if your typical group is a big group. Extremely entertaining. I previously thought I peaked in high school, but I honestly think flipping the script on that smug motherfucker Jack, and subsequently having him unjustly executed may be my greatest achievement.

**Edit:** Oh whups, did I break a rule, or some unspoken etiquette or something?

**Edit 2:** Look, if yall want to insult my intelligence, just save your breath. It's only gonna get you a block. Hope your life gets better.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, just as a disclaimer, I went into the experience super skeptical. It seemed very complex, and we had a huge group (10?). But boy oh boy, did it turn out great. Anyone who likes Hidden werewolf, or Ultimate werewolf, or whatever it&amp;#39;s called would probably love this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secret Hitler is a subterfuge game similar to Hidden Werewolf, except with a few more rules, that (imo) make it more fun/competetive/easier to invest in. Basically, there are Liberals and Fascists, and each side is trying to win. Liberals win by passing 5 liberal &amp;quot;policies&amp;quot; (just tokens gained by a certain set of circumstances), or killing Hitler. Fascists win by selecting Hitler as Chancellor, or passing 6 fascist &amp;quot;policies.&amp;quot; Hitler is a fascist, but does not know the other fascists. The other fascists know each other and Hitler. None of the liberals know anything. So thats the premise. Game time is roughly an hour. There are only 11 policies and one policy basically has to get passed per turn, unless theres a veto, which is more of a late late game thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So just some brief background on our experience, which I will share below because I think its hilarious- our friends are all extremely Type A, and very competitive. One, &amp;quot;Jack,&amp;quot; is hilariously intense when it comes to games, and theres no check on his manicness, lmfao. Hes just (understandably imo) obsessed with the rules, but also insanely competitive and a sore loser to boot. He sounds really annoying, but I actually really enjoy him because hes really nice. Just super intense. He also wins a lot, and is a control freak, so I think a lot of his intensity comes from some mild, uncontrolled anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So anyway, we start the game, and it&amp;#39;s kinda slow. Everyone&amp;#39;s suspicious of everyone (except the Fascists- Me, my fiancee, and another guy named &amp;quot;Brett&amp;quot;, and chick named &amp;quot;Beth&amp;quot; was Hitler. Of note, we were all sitting next to each other, its just how the cards were dealt), and the first couple of turns are kinda slow. Then, its Jack&amp;#39;s turn to be president, which moves clockwise every new turn (and I&amp;#39;m sitting next to him, so I&amp;#39;m after him). One fascist policy has already been passed, which means the president (president selects the chancellor) gets to look at one persons party affiliation. He looks at mine. Sees that I&amp;#39;m fascist. Hes liberal. He immediately tells everyone that I&amp;#39;m fascist, while I, of course, deny deny deny, and deflect as I scramble for a way out of this very early mess. Jack is already making a scene at this point btw. Loud, and very emphatic. The game is heating up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, it&amp;#39;s my turn. Oh shit, wait, I can look at a card too. How can I salvage this situation? By looking at &lt;strong&gt;his card!&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m already acting indignant af, and so I flip it back on him. He. Went. Ballistic. It was &lt;strong&gt;epic.&lt;/strong&gt; I looked at his card, saw the fear in his eyes, and basically was like &amp;quot;ohhhh, that explains why hes so eager to make it seem like I&amp;#39;M a fascist- JACKS a freaking fascist!!&amp;quot; He immediately begins panicking and having a meltdown, and the room devolves into chaos. Nobody can decide who to believe, or if it even matters at this point early in the game, and for me, I&amp;#39;m playing it cool as a cucumber. Just sticking to my very simple story. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People aren&amp;#39;t paying attention. I lean over to Jack, beckoning him closer. He leans in. I whisper, &amp;quot;Even by leaning over, you&amp;#39;re incriminating yourself, and no ones ever going to believe you, motherfucker.&amp;quot; Boom. That was the button. Jack goes full panic mode and starts desperately trying to explain extremely loudly via various attempts at logic and reasoning, how it&amp;#39;s clear that I&amp;#39;m a fascist. But people saw us talking. So, they either think were &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; fascists (~50%), or Jack is (~50%), because hes acting so freaking insane. And this is compounded by me calmly reiterating over and over that &lt;strong&gt;his&lt;/strong&gt; card was the fascist one, while he goes ballistic beside me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game goes on. He gets up on his soapbox every. Single. Turn. He looks crazier and crazier, and more and more desperate, lmao. All the while I&amp;#39;m just subtly stoking the fire and gaslighting the shit out of him publicly. Public opinion shifts. Hes desperately trying to convince them to change to a strategy that 100% would have worked, but nobody trusted him and they began to trust me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the fascist powers later in the game is that the president (regardless of political party) gets to kill someone. I already convinced them to kill &amp;quot;Tina&amp;quot; (a liberal), and Jack has been acting &lt;strong&gt;INSANE&lt;/strong&gt; (because hes &amp;quot;innocent,&amp;quot; and being accused of and treated like hes guilty, BY SOMEONE WHO IS GUILTY, and the entire group is buying it). I convince the group to kill Jack, because hes obviously fascist, so theres a one in four chance hes Hitler, and &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; would win. &lt;strong&gt;JACK GETS EXECUTED FOR HIS TREASON&lt;/strong&gt; (people who are out can not reveal their party or any relevant info). The threat is gone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still actually ended up losing because Brett gave himself away, but hot damn man, before that happened, we managed to secretly kill &lt;em&gt;TWO&lt;/em&gt; of the six liberals, and came so close to getting Beth voted chancellor (the only reason it didnt worl is because Brett voted yes instead of no, which gave away our intentions and lost us the game). We played it perfectly, and it. Was. Hilarious. Jack made such a scene, and I&amp;#39;ve been laughing about it for two days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there are little deceptions too, that have me retrospectively so weak. For example, we (the fascists) noticed that the liberals were clapping every time they passed a liberal policy, so about halfway through the game, we all started clapping every time a liberal policy was passed, lmfaoooo. It was somehow just hilarious, because you look, &lt;strong&gt;and feel,&lt;/strong&gt; wayyyyyy dumber than you&amp;#39;d think fake clapping for something like that, lmao. And my fiancee and Beth and I (Beth figured out the other fascists very fast) were super in sync, and really working as a team to sowe dissent and divide the liberals from within, and we actually managed to pass &lt;strong&gt;FIVE&lt;/strong&gt; fascist policies (which is like, egregiously obvious) by using twisted logic (like, we need to kill Jack, he could be Hitler, etc) and deception. The &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; reason we lost is because Brett gave himself away early, and then sort of checked out and didnt care about the ensuing results, which fucked us when he gave us away on his vote. &lt;/p&gt;

I recently moved into a smaller place, and in my previous location I became very attached to hosting people over for board games/drink/food nights and would love to continue this routine with new people I'm coming across at local meetups.

I don't have a proper dining space so a large gaming table is out of the question, so I'm sort of looking at options that would allow me to host three-four people over and mostly playing over a coffee-table setup. (Which I know isn't ideal at all).

Does anyone have a similar situation? Recommendations I'm specifically looking for are : 

* Seating for people. Stored/Stacked and pulled out for company. (Poufs?)
* Off-table surfaces (T.V trays?) for components and pieces.
* Gaming-table-area solutions (I've considered getting two IKEA LACK tables stacked to the side and pulling them over/replacing my smaller coffee table when company is over).

&lt;p&gt;We have two cities (Buenos Aires and Lima) surrounded entirely by roadblocks (total of four).  Both cities have three faded dudes on them and one of their infection cards is drawn.  What happens?  Since neither city can outbreak through a roadblock and both cities are full do we just place our outbreak stickers on the two cities and take two outbreaks and move on?  One outbreak?  Zero outbreaks? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

I think I understand what the mechanic is, but I’m confused on what qualifies.  

Why is a game like Dixit considered storytelling but not a game like Arkham Horror?

Players actually have control of the outcome in the AH storyline and there’s definitely a story there.  
Dixit being considered a storytelling game makes sense in an abstract way but then so does Codenames: Pictures.

I am very impressed with how well this game is done.

It was fun watching my older son, age 12, revert straight to his analytical thought process of how decisions must be made within the context of the game’s mechanics to try and maximize success, while my younger son’s imagination ran wild.  He had more fun creating the dry erase board with the case info than messing with the game tokens or mechanics of the game itself.  We spent about 5-6 hours just on the first case, and although I think the next 4 cases in the box will go more quickly, the info and clues and decisions don’t appear to be created such that you can figure out the “system” or engine and play it to guarantee a win, like you can with some games.  I believe we will get at least 20 solid hours out of playing without it getting boring or repetitive.  ...and then there are additional campaigns.

I believe we will get at least 20 solid hours out of playing without it getting boring or repetitive.  ...and then there are additional campaigns.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it isn’t a new game, but this is a great option for a family activity that can get your kids to think critically and spend some real fun this summer doing something other than Xbox.   Highly recommend!&lt;/p&gt;

I was a pretty big fan of the original but even I admit that it could get a little complex at times and a little stale.

While the main formula that made the game fun remains the same, they have done a ton of changes that make the game so much better.

\- Better (and shorter) terminology, eliminating long walls of text and simplifying things. It also usually leaves a lot more room for the art which makes the cards look better.

\- A MASSIVE upgrade in story. Instead of having basically no story at all (anything story-related was printed on small cards), there is now a storybook. It now tells you a story about your adventure which helps you immerse yourself in the experience a lot more.

\- A lot of things have been streamlined which leads to a little bit quicker set-up time and playtime which allows you to spend less time managing the game and more time playing it.

\- Difficulty has been better balanced. A lot of scenarios would be too easy or too hard. It seems like they have done a good job at better balancing it so you have a challenge, but not to the point of frustration. You also now have the ability of adjusting the difficulty (something you couldn't do before without using house rules). You can make locations smaller or larger (making the game easier/harder, shorter/longer) and can use wildcards to increase the difficulty of the game. So if you feel the default level is still too easy or too hard, or perhaps too short or too long, you can adjust it to meet your needs.

\- Related to the above point, you can no longer throw everything at a card (usually a villain that would end the game) and have a million dice and a guaranteed chance of winning. There is a new rule that, unless the card says you can play it freely, you can only use one of each type of boon amongst your entire group. The rule before was you could only use one of each type of boon per character. So in a four-player game you could theoretically play four weapons, four blessings, four items, four spells, four allies on one check to obliterate it. This change leads to more tension (but not to the point where it's too hard).

\- They have significantly increased cooperative play. In the old version, there were ways to help your fellow party members out for sure, but most of the time, it was more useful to separate yourselves to tackle locations. Now, there is more strategy involved. There are several new cards and powers that reward you for staying together so you have to weigh your options.

If you played previous expansions of Pathfinder, you can still use them with the new core set. They have done a conversion guide that can help you convert cards. Most cards don't need it, but for the special cases, you can use this guide to find out what to do with them in the new set.

Anyway, I won't go on any further. If you want to read up on the changes in more detail, visit  [https://paizo.com/community/blog/tags/pathfinderAdventureCardGame](https://paizo.com/community/blog/tags/pathfinderAdventureCardGame)

Whether you're a fan of the original game or never tried it before, there is no better time to get into it. It really is a blast.

Edit: I forgot to mention a big addition to the game: avenge. If a player fails a check against a bane, another player (usually at the same location by burying a card but sometimes allowed at a different location by using a power) can avenge the player by taking on the card him/herself. This can be really useful because there may be another character better suited to defeat the bane and you don't want it to get away - especally if it's the villain.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t want to do a huge, full review of it since it&amp;#39;s still &lt;em&gt;Pathfinder Adventure Card Game&lt;/em&gt;, but I just wanted to mention that the new core set and its first expansion (&lt;em&gt;Curse of the Crimson Throne&lt;/em&gt;) is now out.&lt;/p&gt;

My smaller box games not shown

&amp;#x200B;

Started into the hobby over 7 years ago looking for family games and games to give for kids at Christmas, etc. I'm a husband and father of four (ages 9 to 18)  and the kids and wife mostly enjoy gaming. Family gaming can be hard because the kids are usually busy during the week and tired and cranky by the evenings. Started coordinating game nights  with friends and gaming lunches at work around 3 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I've  enjoyed a very active resale market in Austin which lets me try lots of things and then move them on if not for me. The down side is that all the buying and selling takes precious time away from playing games. So right now I want to play more of what I have, acquire and turn over less, get my unplayed games to table,  and keep my collection lean.

&amp;#x200B;

Beyond family gaming, I'm really enjoying 3 main game groups at the moment, a weekly medium/heavy game group, monthly lighter game group, and weekly lunch game group.

&amp;#x200B;

* Favorites: Five Tribes, Ethnos, The Estates, Endeavor
* Unplayed: Rococo, Gaia Project, Deus + exp, Everdell (recent trade), New Frontiers (recent purchase), Calimala
* Other recent acquisitions: The Estates, Modern Art, Res Arcana, Warsaw: City of Ruins (not pictured)
* Lunch/lighter games: Cubby with Samurai
* Least favorites but games the family enjoys: Bottom two cubbies
* Considering: Yedo &amp; Underwater Cities","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/XXp1ipt""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/XXp1ipt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I brought it during kickstarter with all the expansions and it is awesome!  We played roughly 20 hours in the past two days, which was longer than a normal work day (including the casual work day reddit-ing of course).

What made this game great is the replayability.  With all the expansions, every game play was completely unique and different from the first.  The actions are simple, yet there are so many choices on how you want to go on your adventure.  Do we want to fish for food and play it safe, press on and explore the new hidden passage, aim to complete the scenario, or mess with that random bird over there.  The open world is definitely a unique board game idea to us and we loved it.  Sharing symbols and team play decisions made it a great coop game.

Pros:

- Replayability.  So many expansion and adventures.  Feels like we barely even hit 5% of the cards yet.

- Cooperation and nearly all action/decisions matters as it can affect the game in the long term.  Also could be a 1 player game (but I have not tried)

- Fun risk taking &amp; reward.  It gives the sense that you can achieve most goals if you are willing to spend more resources and if failed, it was because of your own choice/risk.

- Unique mechanism.  If you read those Choose your own Adventure books, it's like that, but on a board game.


Cons:

- Table space!  We ended up playing on the floor after the first full game since our sessions were so long.  The map is huge and probably intended to be save/loaded more often.

- Expensive, but worth it in my opinion.  Even just the base game will give hours and hours of play time.

- Not sold in retail.  Hard to find copies.

I just wanted to share my experience and give the game credit for giving us such a great weekend and many many days to come...

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table space!  We ended up playing on the floor after the first full game since our sessions were so long.  The map is huge and probably intended to be save/loaded more often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expensive, but worth it in my opinion.  Even just the base game will give hours and hours of play time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not sold in retail.  Hard to find copies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to share my experience and give the game credit for giving us such a great weekend and many many days to come...  Happy board gaming everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

I recently rearranged my 1 bedroom apartment because my wife and I are expecting a baby boy! He's due in late October. My wife has been begging me to go ahead and rearranged the apartment to make room for a crib, rocking chair, and a few other things. I love spatial puzzles, so I spent all day rearranging the entire apartment while my wife was out. She LOVED the surprise. And better yet, because of this, I was finally able to get all my games in one place for the first time!


PSA: For those worried about boardgame box discoloration from the sunlight, we keep those blinds closed almost all the time and are getting blackout curtain for the baby soon too. 


Not Pictured: *Betrayal Legacy*, *Secret Hitler*, and *Okiya/Niya*.


**How long have you been in the hobby?**


I have been in the hobby for almost 3 years. Started with *X-Wing*, *Betrayal*, and *Smash Up*. Those opened the door to a world I fell in love with. I had about 70+ games a year ago. But then I realized, there were so many I didn't play. So I like to float around 50 now. I resell games I don't play anymore. Luckily, an FLGS near me has a resale program where they have them in store and take a 20% cut. I do this to help them out and then I use money from there to buy new games. It's a great system and keep my overall spending down a since the money cycles through.


**What would you change about your collection if you could?**


Not much. I am very satisfied with what I have. Having more games that work well with 5 would be really nice though. Other than that, I want to add the *AFFO Norwegians Expansion* and the *Scythe Modular Board.* Maybe adding more Uwe Rosenberg like *Fields of Arle* or something might be nice? But *AFFO* and *Agricola* kinda cover that niche. Generally, I am not in need of anything specific and absolutely love my collection as is. 



**Favorite Games:**


*Scythe.* I just love this game. Engine building, area control, combat, resource management. I have bought everything for it except the new board and the metal mechs. I haven't played *Rise of Fenris* all the way through yet, so I haven't added it to the Legendary Box just yet.


*Agricola.* I played this for the first time about 2 months ago. I bought it the next day. I don't know how it took so long for me to get it. This has shot its way to Number 1 on my list. I already bought the 5-6 player expansion and the Artifex and Bubulcus decks. Also, this is my wife's new favorite game game as well.


*Coloretto.* My favorite card game of all time. And its not even close. Take that, set collection, all out competition. And it looks great on the table too!


**Newest Game:** 


*Fury of Dracula.* Just got this last week, so I am not adding it to my Shelf of Shame. I am soooooooo pumped to play this. I have been studying the rules and am going to try and get it to the table with one of my two groups soon.


**Guilty Pleasure Game:**


*The Colonists.* I consider this a guilty pleasure because I might only play this one a couple times in my life, but it will always be worth it. The spatial and optimization puzzle is like no other. People say it feels empty or incomplete at the end, I call and raise on that. I think it is so smooth and flows so well. Every turn matters. The sprawling hexes on the table at the end of Era IV is absolutely magnificent. 


**Shelf of Shame:**


*Pandemic Rising Tide* and *Pandemic Fall of Rome.* Just haven't gotten around to them yet. 


*Cryptid.* I can't get people to buy into playing this one just yet for some reason. 



**Games Wishlist:**

*Istanbul*, *Kemet*, *Through the Desert*. 


If you have any other games that are great with 5, I would love to hear some suggestions!

*How long have you been involved in the hobby?*

Been playing games for awhile, I’d say around 5 years now consistently. A few years ago I really got into gaming with, of course, Catan. Then Ticket to Ride. Then Pandemic (all of which are still at my parents house as I didn’t own them). We meet weekly now for games. 

*What would you change about your collection?*

I really have everything I need. I’d probably trim a little fat, not buy so many so quickly. At one point I was pretty much buying one a week. 

*Favorite games?*

Carcassonne, Wingspan, Castles of Burgundy, Catan, Galaxy Trucker, Sagrada, Rajas of the Ganges, Azul, Automania

*Least Favorites?*

Sheriff of Nottingham, Splendor, Imhotep, Indulgence. Keyflower

*Most Played?*

Probably Guillotine, Wingspan, and Bohnanza.

*Newest Games?*

Tiny Towns, Karuba, FLick Em' Up!

*New games coming*

Century Spice Road

*Games on my Want List*

Consumption, Quacks of Quedlinburg, Barenpark, B-17: Queen of the Skies, Glass Road, A'la Carte, Raptor, Welcome To...","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/gallery/jehOlbA""&gt;https://imgur.com/gallery/jehOlbA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter board game projects that are either:

- **newly posted in the past 7 days**, or
- **ending in the next 7 days (starting Jun 10)** and have at least a fighting chance of being funded.

All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, **no need to ask.** (The occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!)

Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between midnight and noon PST.

## Footnotes
- `#hmm` means that something about the project seems a little off. Buyer beware kinda thing.
- `#lolwut` is reserved for projects that seem like copycat games or campaigns put together with little thought. Check 'em out for amusement.
- `#take` tags are for projects that have been restarted for some reason, with the number indicating what iteration we're currently on.
- Did I miss something? Particularly something **new in the last 7 days** or **ending in the next 7 days**? Let me know in the comments and I'll add it in.

&lt;p&gt;This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter board game projects that are either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;newly posted in the past 7 days&lt;/strong&gt;, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ending in the next 7 days (starting Jun 10)&lt;/strong&gt; and have at least a fighting chance of being funded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, &lt;strong&gt;no need to ask.&lt;/strong&gt; (The occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between midnight and noon PST.&lt;/p&gt;

My current board game shelves are getting a bit crunched, so I'm looking for a storage unit. Normally I'd just snap up a Kallax of the appropriate dimensions (roughly 5 feet wide).

Granted, having a back isn't necessary. It would just be very nice because I'm on the obsessive side and having a bunch of board games unevenly placed in their units facing me at my desk would kind of grind my gears. (I know; that's weird.) But I can live with it.

&amp;nbsp; 

Last year my partner and I discovered we both had a  love of board games, and so we started our collection. We have just moved house and I built a new kallax unit that needs filling! So we were hoping for new suggestions.

&amp;nbsp; 

We (as you can see) have a love for euros/worker placements. **Architects**, **Concordia** and **Viticulture** are probably some of our favourites. Although we do like the super simple / competitive games like **Shotten Totten** and **Lost treasures**. 

&amp;nbsp; 

Sometimes we have friends round and we like to play things like **ultimate werewolf** or **citidels**, but mostly we like to keep it just the 2 of us. 

&amp;nbsp; 

Our surprise of the last year has to be **Terraforming Mars**. We generally like magic/medieval themes so a space-age game was really unexpected. 

&amp;nbsp;

Additionally, for the first time we now have a lot more playing space and we were interested in longer games, possibly things that really feel like an investment, **pandemic legacy** is on our wishlist, though personally I'd be interested in games like the PC series **Civilization** were you really become invested in games. Often things like **The kings guild** feel too short for us. 

&amp;nbsp;

1. So I didn’t back the first two kickstarters and I’m thinking about ordering them from Amazon. Do they come with the Kickstarter exclusives? I know it seems like a dumb question but I could not find an answer anywhere and I couldn’t find any unboxing of the second prints. 

2. Assuming the Kickstarter exclusives don’t come with the second prints of the base game and expansion do they come with the newest expansion? Like if I order the revenge expansion upgrade kit will it come with the Kickstarter exclusive little pouch bags, the titan, the wolf, and other exclusives from the previous kickstarters, or will it only be the exclusives in the revenge expansion presented there?

And also I know the ultimate edition is cheaper but I’m all for getting things quicker cause I have no patience.

Despite a fairly high luck element, Fluxx can be a very fun social game with the right group, due to its unusual and even chaotic game-play, also because it plays so quickly.

But because Fluxx is ever-changing, we shouldn't be surprised to discover that the publisher has found yet another way to change up the game. And that's by introducing a whole new style of art, to fit with a new fairy tale theme. Enter Mary Engelbreit, whom the Looney Labs team brought on board for their latest version: [**Fairy Tale Fluxx**](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/255013/fairy-tale-fluxx).

**IMPRESSIONS**

**Fluxx-like**: This game is very, very close to the original Fluxx game that I have. It has a whole different look and feel, of course, but the majority of the New Rule and Action cards are the same. That isn't a bad thing, because it's a tried and true game system, and it does mean that it is well balanced and fun. Of course if you never liked the original Fluxx, this isn't likely to change your negative opinion.

**Uncomplicated**: Some of the later Fluxx games introduced other card types, like ""Surprises"", ""Creepers"", and even ""Ungoals"". Pirate Fluxx, for example, also has different icons corresponding to different groups of Keepers (e.g. ships), which also has significance for the game-play. Those looking to really change things up from the original Fluxx will appreciate the extra complexity and twists these additions bring. But Fairy Tale Fluxx has none of those things, and keeps things simple. Considering that the target market is families and children, I think this is a good decision.

**Fairy tale theme**: I'm always amazed how a different theme can really change the feel of a game, and that's definitely true with many of the Fluxx gmaes, including this one. There aren't many rule changes with Fairy Tale Fluxx, and it's quite true to the original. But all the Keepers and the Goal cards are entirely different, and emerge from the world of fairy tales, and that makes the entire game feel quite different.

**Fairy tale artwork**: The artwork by Mary Engelbreit deserves special mention, and will be one of the things that makes this version of Fluxx particularly appealing. My first experience with the original Fluxx was with a game that had very simple black-and-white illustrations. But with Fairy Tale Fluxx that all changes, because we get colourful and detailed images, in the usual Mary Engelbreit style. That really does add something to the game, and help make the world of fairy tales come alive.

**Fairy tale graphic design**: It's not just the theme and the artwork that has changed, but the whole graphic design of the cards has had a makeover with this edition. This is especially evident with the titles at the top of the cards, with the words ""Action"", ""New Rule"", ""Keeper"", and ""Goal"" all employing a more playful font that is in keeping with the theme. The creativity of the font can perhaps distract from its clarity, but fortunately the colour coding of the card types ensures that we'll never get anything mixed up, and the different card types also have helpful icons to keep them distinguished. The rest of the card text is all in a sensible and plain font that is easy to read.

**Family friendly**: The original Fluxx was never intended to be a serious strategic game, and Fairy Tale Fluxx continues the same simple formula that has made the series popular. There's a good dose of luck, but that doesn't make the game frustrating to play, because you always feel that things could suddenly fall your way if the right card shows up, and there's always this chance of winning. The game-play is all about the fun of interaction, and capitalizing on the cards in your hand. The short game-time helps, with games usually only taking 10-15 minutes. Given how easy the rules are, this makes it an ideal game for families and non-gamers, and it can really be enjoyed as a light social game in almost any group.

**RECOMMENDATION**

So is **Fairy Tale Fluxx** for you, and is it a fairy tale wish come true? If you've never played Fluxx at all, and are considering picking it up, then you might want to consider getting this version instead. The fairy tale theme should especially appeal to children and families. And yet it doesn't feel childish, because even adults are more than familiar with the classic tales underlying the cards, and it's still fun to try to put together the Keepers needed to win the game.

In many respects the charming artwork of Mary Engelbreit and the imaginative theme add some welcome colour and life to the more generic Fluxx, even though the game-play is largely the same. It isn't a game that will start a revolution, but Fairy Tale Fluxx certainly can add some fun to your tabletop and to a social event with family or friends. Enjoyable for everyone - even with the ugly step sisters!

Playing board games has been great for getting away from the computer games, while still being challenging and social. It's been great to see everyone excited to play games when going to meetups, and meeting new friends along the way!

A few games that are not included in the pictures are **Jaipur, Hive Pocket, Love Letter, &amp; Friday**.

***How long have you been in the hobby?***

I went to a meetup because I was bored a year ago in June, and played Sagrada, Scythe, and Carcassonne. It was great! Met some great people, and from a few other meetups I now have a core group of about 5 people that get together often, as well as a weekly group at work.

***What would you change about your collection if you could?***

I am happy with where my collection stands, as I have a game that satisfies most of the different mechanics that I look for in a game. If I had to change something, however, I'd probably get rid of Puerto Rico. The newer games with the nice components seem to be the ones I'm drawn to.

***Favorite Games***

Currently my top three games in my collection are:

**Scythe**: This game is my collection prize. I have all the expansions, upgraded tokens and coins, promo cards, and both Broken Token organizers in the Legendary box. I also recently got the modular board. After my play-through of this game today, I have logged my 84 time playing Scythe!

**7-Wonders Duel**: My favorite game to play as 2 players in my collection. Love the drafting from the pyramid, as well as the multiple win conditions that can sneak up on you.

**Blood Rage**: Not using a conflict type of gamer, but this area-control game with the drafting is so satisfying. All of my games have been close, and multiple strategies have won games, so it's very open each time we play.

***Shame List***

I'm happy to say that I have played everything in the collection at least 4 times (expect Puerto Rico (2 times))!

***Next games to add to the collection***

There isn't really anything on my radar at the moment; I'm looking forward to just playing what I have more. However, if anyone thinks a game would be a great add to my collection, I'd love to hear recommendations!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collection: &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/sY4ciax""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/sY4ciax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I purchased a sealed copy of XenoShyft: Dreadmire from a seller on Amazon. At the time I did not notice that it was not directly from Amazon, but even still that doesn’t fully factor into this. 

The game arrive brand new and sealed. I gleefully opened the game and almost immediately noticed that a brood board was missing (as you can see in [this photo](https://imgur.com/bjSzlG7)). That’s not exactly worth returning to Amazon as every other publisher I’ve ever dealt with has gladly fixed their errors. [This is also where I should mention I’d be even less inclined—assuming I had the option—of returning the product to the seller as it’s no longer sealed/brand new and that would hurt what I assume is a smaller game store. 

So I wrote to CMON with the attached photo saying: 


&gt; “Good morning,
Yesterday I received my order of XenoShyft Dreadmire from Amazon (Order# *redacted*) It arrived brand new in shrink wrap. Today I opened it with my fiance to learn and play before our Sunday family game day and we noticed that there are only 3 of the ""Brood Lane Dashboards"" in the box. However, we have 4 of the ""Nortec Lane Dashboards."" The manual says there should be 4 of both. This won't stop us from learning and playing the game this weekend as we can use a homemade Brood Lane as a stand in, but I was wondering if it is possible to have the missing piece ... placed? (Is it technically a ""re""placement if it wasn't in here to start? haha).
Thank you for your time,
/u/its_polystyrene



A week went by, I sleeved all of the cards and then this afternoon received this email:

&gt; “Thank you for reaching out to us! Unfortunately, we are no longer offering customer support on Xenoshyft: Dreadmire as that product has gone out of print and we have no current plans to produce another printing at this time. We apologize for any inconvenience. Thank you and have good day.”


Now, I’ve never purchased a CMON game, and I get that Kickstarter games go out of print etc. but is it really that likely that mine was the only one missing boards to the point that they did not have replacement ones? The game is not THAT old as we are now about halfway through 2019. 

I feel like this is poor on CMON’s part. I understand that they did in fact literally answered my email which asked if it was possible, but I know I’m not alone in the fact that when I inquire about a fault of someone else that it is less a literal question and more of a way of letting them fix their mistake gracefully. The issue I see here is that A sealed game should not be missing a component especially of this size. That to me seems like a large oversight. Once this package is opened even if I do return it (or can return it) it only affects and hurts the small game store I bought it from. If I decide to keep it and CMON refuses to fix their mistake it only hurts me in both resale/trade value in the future (since it is an incomplete game) and in aesthetics of the game being played (and let’s not pretend aesthetics aren’t part of CMONs general strategy anyways—even if this game has flimsy boards).


Again, I feel it’s poor on their part, but I’m open to hearing that I am wrong.

It comes with 90 over-sized cards with attractive an graphic design and artwork. With each game playable in less than 15 minutes, you can expect to get in at least a dozen plays before you've discovered the entire system. The basic concept is fairly straight forward: cards have numbers, and you're using sets of cards to capture ""Fortresses"". To capture a fortress from another player, you must play a set of cards worth more than theirs. But you don't know the exact strength of their defenders, so there's considerable bluffing involved, and numerous twists will be introduced that affect how the value of your cards are calculated, and other elements get added to the gameplay as the rules change. Can you win the game by being the player with the largest number of fortresses?

**GAME-PLAY**

The main aim of Fast Forward FORTRESS is to play cards to capture fortresses, by playing a set of cards of the highest value. Because you don't know the value of the cards currently beneath the fortress, there's considerable scope for bluffing. The game also employs Friedeman Friese's fable concept, in that you learn the rules as you play, and cards with new rules and mechanics emerge as the game progresses. Occasionally the rules may create some ambiguities, although fortunately anything that isn't clear won't usually be game-breaking. A big reason that accounts for why Fortress is so entertaining is to play the fun of discovering these new rules, cards, and mechanics. Some people even find that the fable concept works better than the concept of legacy games. The game does start fairly slowly, but over time becomes more and more interesting. Most individual games only take around ten minutes, while playing through the entire system will take about 90 minutes. There is an addictive quality that will keep you playing games one after another, but there is replayability even once you have gone through the entire system. Even those uninterested in playing the entire system more than once, found that Fortress was worth playing through even just once, given how much fun it was.

**IMPRESSIONS**

Friedemann Friese continues to impress with his creative approach to game design, and Fast Forward: FORTRESS is another fine entry in the excellent Fast Forward series. Admittedly, serious gamers who can't stand light and tactical games might find this an exercise in frustration. Or they may find it more interesting as a theoretical concept in game development than as a gaming experience that they want to be part of, due to the fact that it is a relatively small and light game. But even many of them won't be able to help themselves admiring the clever game system, and may even find that the process of discovering the rules and cards is far more fun than they ever expected.

The game-play is not at all difficult to learn, and you will have to change your approach as new cards and new rules get added to the game. With virtually all of the Fast Forward games, this one included, there have been reports of issues with the clarity of the rules in certain situations. That is almost inevitable with a game of this type, but fortunately most questions can be easily answered by consulting BoardGameGeek forums.

Certainly a lot of the fun of this game can be attributed to the joy of discovery. But fortunately that's not the only thing that Fortress offers. The game really encourages bluffing, and this is a mechanic that I personally enjoy a great deal. It plays very quickly, making it ideal for a filler, but the changing rules, cards, and gameplay means it offers something unique that you won't find in your average filler. This gives it a very addictive quality, and even though most games are finished in under 10 minutes, you'll often find players wanting to play over and again. Even if you decide to shelve the game after playing through the system once, you'll usually be more than satisfied that you've had your money's worth. But I believe that Fast Forward: FORTRESS does hold enough interest for return visits beyond this, especially with different players or player counts, and due to the fact that it is a light gaming experience that commends itself as a filler.

**RECOMMENDATION**

Fast Forward: FORTRESS may have a small box, but inside there is a unique Friedemann Friese game experience that provides an enormous amount of fun. You'll enjoy exploring the different twists and turns as you learn the game, especially the first time through. I recommend the entire Fast Forward series, and this is no exception!

&lt;p&gt;The main aim of Fast Forward FORTRESS is to play cards to capture fortresses, by playing a set of cards of the highest value. Because you don&amp;#39;t know the value of the cards currently beneath the fortress, there&amp;#39;s considerable scope for bluffing. The game also employs Friedeman Friese&amp;#39;s fable concept, in that you learn the rules as you play, and cards with new rules and mechanics emerge as the game progresses. Occasionally the rules may create some ambiguities, although fortunately anything that isn&amp;#39;t clear won&amp;#39;t usually be game-breaking. A big reason that accounts for why Fortress is so entertaining is to play the fun of discovering these new rules, cards, and mechanics. Some people even find that the fable concept works better than the concept of legacy games. The game does start fairly slowly, but over time becomes more and more interesting. Most individual games only take around ten minutes, while playing through the entire system will take about 90 minutes. There is an addictive quality that will keep you playing games one after another, but there is replayability even once you have gone through the entire system. Even those uninterested in playing the entire system more than once, found that Fortress was worth playing through even just once, given how much fun it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMPRESSIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friedemann Friese continues to impress with his creative approach to game design, and Fast Forward: FORTRESS is another fine entry in the excellent Fast Forward series. Admittedly, serious gamers who can&amp;#39;t stand light and tactical games might find this an exercise in frustration. Or they may find it more interesting as a theoretical concept in game development than as a gaming experience that they want to be part of, due to the fact that it is a relatively small and light game. But even many of them won&amp;#39;t be able to help themselves admiring the clever game system, and may even find that the process of discovering the rules and cards is far more fun than they ever expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game-play is not at all difficult to learn, and you will have to change your approach as new cards and new rules get added to the game. With virtually all of the Fast Forward games, this one included, there have been reports of issues with the clarity of the rules in certain situations. That is almost inevitable with a game of this type, but fortunately most questions can be easily answered by consulting BoardGameGeek forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly a lot of the fun of this game can be attributed to the joy of discovery. But fortunately that&amp;#39;s not the only thing that Fortress offers. The game really encourages bluffing, and this is a mechanic that I personally enjoy a great deal. It plays very quickly, making it ideal for a filler, but the changing rules, cards, and gameplay means it offers something unique that you won&amp;#39;t find in your average filler. This gives it a very addictive quality, and even though most games are finished in under 10 minutes, you&amp;#39;ll often find players wanting to play over and again. Even if you decide to shelve the game after playing through the system once, you&amp;#39;ll usually be more than satisfied that you&amp;#39;ve had your money&amp;#39;s worth. But I believe that Fast Forward: FORTRESS does hold enough interest for return visits beyond this, especially with different players or player counts, and due to the fact that it is a light gaming experience that commends itself as a filler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RECOMMENDATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast Forward: FORTRESS may have a small box, but inside there is a unique Friedemann Friese game experience that provides an enormous amount of fun. You&amp;#39;ll enjoy exploring the different twists and turns as you learn the game, especially the first time through. I recommend the entire Fast Forward series, and this is no exception!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where to get it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Fast Forward: FORTRESS is available from the publisher Stronghold Games (&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=""https://strongholdgames.com/store/board-games/fast-forward-fortress/""&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

NFP includes 16  Airplane Figures, 3 Airplane Stands, 30 Air Combat Cards, 8 Summary  Cards, 15 Nation Markers, 18 Machine Gun and 12 Bomb Markers, 1 Rules  booklet and 1 Scenario booklet with 21 new Scenarios.

What's important to notice here is that while the box includes an awesome amount of historical aircraft, ***it only includes*** ***3 airplane stands.*** Looking forward to epic air battles? Well, not with three stands. Memoir '44 is a ground warfare game, but this expansion is dedicated to air combat and includes at least three planes for every Memoir '44 faction. With so many planes in the box but not enough stands for even two factions to have all their planes in the air seems like a blatant attempt to force dedicated players to purchase two copies of the expansion. This is something avid Memoir '44 players do compulsively but it's a bit sad to see the expansion so hamstrung out of the gate.

Despite being scarce, the stands are well designed with a slot on them to place a visual marker to indicate what aircraft you have in play, which is really useful because ***all of the planes are the same color plastic***. Players not wanting to check a token to figure out what faction's plane is in the air will have to paint their models. I speed painted my planes to somewhat match the faction plastic for my ground forces, plus I color coded my planes' wingtips to match the Summary Cards to indicate if an aircraft is a fighter, a fighter-bomber, or a bomber. This might seem redundant, but there are several models that are somewhat in-between size wise which could make it difficult at first glance to figure out whether your armor units are at risk from an aircraft or not. This bit of reference paint solves a gameplay problem, but it does remove some of the realism from the painted aircraft.

The models themselves are satisfactory and on par with the rest of Memoir '44. The heavy bombers look great and were really fun to paint. The smaller fighters, on the other hand, lack detail and don't hold their shape well - several of the small fighters had bent tail ends. This was pretty mild, but noticeable. If you're a perfectionist you might want to use some hot water to try to set the models straight because I imagine most of the kits will have this problem. The small fighter models are also so tiny that I really worry about losing them.

The cards and markers are standard Memoir '44, with the Air Combat cards being treated as all other Combat Cards introduced in Winter Wars, Sword of Stalingrad, and Through Jungle and Desert. If you haven't played with Combat Cards before, then this will be new to you. What's cool is if you have these other expansions, you can mix and match Air Combat in with these other collections, making for some really interesting scenarios.

If you're a Memoir '44 fan and considering buying this set I would say you should ***maybe*** buy it. Do you own most of the other Combat cards? Then definitely buy it; the potential for fun and interesting Combat Card synergies is too good to pass up. Do you mostly play two players? Buy it if you're interested in seeing what a few planes can do to the battlefield but don't expect epic air duels due to a lack of stands. Do you mostly play Overlord? It seems like you need two copies to make the expansion Overlord-ready, but that is the case with most Memoir '44 expansions.

But each time we&amp;#39;ve played it was a dud. We like dudes on a map games, and the combat is deep and interesting, just feel like there is something here, and I&amp;#39;m missing it. So if you like this game tell me why? I don&amp;#39;t want to miss out on a great game because I&amp;#39;m not getting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

My hope is that someone from there keeps an eye on this forum. The bank setups in the current Iron Clays Kickstarter campaign are strongly leaning towards 18xx or extremely heavy economic simulations, and are very underwhelming for Eurogamers.

In Eurogames, you don't exactly end up with that much money at one time. For example, the ""100"" denomination chips just aren't useful compared to lower denominations when it comes to Eurogames. 

They list games like 7 Wonders, Brass Birmingham, Castles of Mad King Ludwig, Clans of Caledonia, Concordia, Dinosaur Island, Great Western Trail, Isle of Skye, Istanbul, Lords of Waterdeep, Manhattan Project, Orleans, Raiders of the North Sea, Scythe, and Viticulture as a good fit, compatibility wise, for their 100 set of chips. 

But in all of these types of games, gobs of 1s, 3s, 5s, 10s, and 20s and maybe some 50s would be dramatically more useful than the layouts they offer. 100 chips are almost a total waste and of very little use. Anything higher than 100 is obviously absurdly too high for Eurogames. 

For the 200 set, they are replacing one of the only two sleeves of 10s, which are probably one of the most useful denominations for Eurogames with 50s, which are questionably useful, while having a full sleeve of 500s, which is more money than all players will have combined at any one time in most Euros. 

I hope that, in the next 10 days, they add on an ""Iron Clays Euro"" package for people who will mostly be playing the games they list in the compatibility section on their Kickstarter page. It hurts to pay such a premium for these chips and receive so many dead chips that will never be of use unless one gets into a whole new genre of games.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would post this in the comments on the Iron Clays Kickstarter page, but you can only comment if you&amp;#39;ve backed the campaign, and I don&amp;#39;t feel I&amp;#39;m ready to do that yet.

&amp;#x200B;

**How long have you been involved in the hobby?**

&amp;#x200B;

Some background:

My wife and I received Catan and Carcasonne some years ago as gifts after playing them elsewhere but we never cracked them open at the time.  About 3 years ago my interest in collecting comic books led us to go into a comic/game store while on vacation where we first discovered how many designer games there are, as this particular shop had them wall to wall / ceiling to floor.  We were overwhelmed by the selection which was  obvious to another customer in the store who asked if we played games and we told them this would be our first purchase of a designer game.  She recommended as the must buy first purchase Dominion (1st ed.) which we took her up on.  That game went on a shelf when we got back from vacation and sat there for a year or so.

&amp;#x200B;

About a year or so later we finally decided to crack it open since it was quite expensive, unwrapped all the cards, my wife started reading the manual and gave up shortly after.  We put all cards back and the game went back on the shelf.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to summer 2018, we had been playing mainstream games while waiting for dinner to cook etc.  Things like Mille Bornes, Rack-O, Rummikkub.  That got us talking about the Dominion game we shelved a year earlier and we decided to give it another go. This time we stuck with it and we instantly fell in love with it.

&amp;#x200B;

From there on out we started visiting BGG and getting a feel for the kind of games we wanted to try. One of the benefits of getting into this hobby late was that a lot of collectors were getting rid of older games (new to us) to make room for new ones. That allowed to take advantage of some really great bulk deals to kick start our collection.

&amp;#x200B;

**What would you change about your collection if you could?**

&amp;#x200B;

One regret is giving up on Dominion so easily years ago as we missed out on several years of enjoying that game and many others.  Part and parcel with that is the fact we narrowing missed acquiring 7th Continent via Kickstarter on a short re-release as that happened around the same time we let ourselves be intimidated by the Dominion rule book.  Now that we're much more comfortable with terminology and play styles we know it's a game we would love, but also very close to the top of our wish list.

&amp;#x200B;

As far regretful purchases in our collection, my wife and I have so far have put in a lot of research, testing at game cafes, videos, etc prior to purchasing almost all of our games.  We've been very fortunate that almost of our collection gets played every 6 months.  With exception of  Shadowrun Crossfire where we discovered the particular engine used was not to our liking and can create wide swings of difficulty which is frustrating.

&amp;#x200B;

**About our collection**

&amp;#x200B;

We started building our collection under the premise that we needed to balance our purchases with lighter games when we have our game night with my 70 year old parents every weekend and heavier games when it's just my wife &amp; I playing.  You will see this reflected in the pictures.  This year however we have been exposing my parents to heavier games and now the delineation when purchasing games isn't really needed.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents have successfully learned and played Pandemic, Stone Age, Citadels and Clank will be most likely next weekend.  This breakthrough has lowered the restrictions on how my wife &amp; I buy things as we initially wanted to expose my parents to lighter designers games but now we feel they're capable of playing anything we would enjoy as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Majority of our games are acquired via classifieds, with gifts and new buys being the minority.

&amp;#x200B;

**Current Favorites**

&amp;#x200B;

Her: Sentinels of the Multiverse, Thunderstone Advance, Covert, Great Western Trail, Decrypto

Me: Roll Player, Dominion, Sentinels of the Multivese, Imperial Settlers, Great Western Trail, 7 Wonders Duel

&amp;#x200B;

**Newest Games**

&amp;#x200B;

\- Clank

\- Azul

\- Sagrada

\- Kingsforge

\- Architects of the West Kingdom

&amp;#x200B;

**Prized Possessions**

&amp;#x200B;

Our Sentinels of the Multiverse big box with the drawers and room for all the expansions.  One of our first bulk purchases when we got into this included Sentinels of the Multiverse deluxe with over 50% of the expansion content, environments, etc in the box.  We fell in love with the game and picked up some of the missing content and bought the big box to hold it all.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife owns a woodworking shop and I aided in the construction of a custom dice tray and card holders which always get attention.

&amp;#x200B;

**Have / Haven't played**

&amp;#x200B;

We make a concerted effort to rotate the games we play as much as we can so everything is played in our collection to some degree.  We do get in grooves where we fall in love with a game again that hadn't been played much and go on a binge with it.  That being said there are a few games that don't see too much action

&amp;#x200B;

\- Shadowrun Crossfire: for reason listed above

\- Kingdom Builder: I like it, wife hates it.  Have only played 2 player.  Thinking of trying with the parents to see if it's better @ 4

\- Power Grid: Didn't mind it but theme didn't really do anything for us, no expansions.  Also only played with 2 player

\- Ascension Darkness Unleashed: First Ascension game we got, but then we picked up Immortal Heroes which we prefer over it.

\- Marvel Dice Masters X-Men vs Avengers: Found the rules confusing and we're not fans of direct conflict games.

&amp;#x200B;

**Potentially leaving collection**

&amp;#x200B;

\- Shadowrun Crossfire

\- Kingdom Builder

\- Ascension Darkness Unleashed

\- Marvel Dice Masters X-Men vs Avengers

\- Munchkin: Not fun with 2 players, we did finally play it with 3 but it didn't get better for us.  It was an early somewhat un-research purchase.

&amp;#x200B;

**Gaming Habits**

&amp;#x200B;

My wife &amp; I play at least a few games during the week, followed by a 'game night' with my parents every weekend which usually consists of a 5 hour session of 2 heavy hitter games and 2 fillers.  This replaced a previous weekend 'movie night' and we're finding this a lot more entertaining.

&amp;#x200B;

**Misc**

&amp;#x200B;

\- My wife &amp; I have near 500 logged plays each and the parents have just passed 150 plays each.

\- I log every possible detail to BGG (I'm a software engineer) and like to have as much data as possible.

\- Our current gaming table is our 3 x 7' farmhouse dining table which we just purchased a 'Big Viking Game Mats' mat for.

\- We have kickstarted 4 or 5 games now and enjoy helping getting these cool game designs published where they might not otherwise come into existence.

\- Shelving unit is currently an Ikea Kallax at max capacity.  Looking to add an 8 cubby unit soon.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Have been enjoying exploring everyone's collections and reading about their designer hobby experiences.  Looking forward to answering any questions you might have for us about our developing collection.

This breakthrough has lowered the restrictions on how my wife &amp;amp; I buy things as we initially wanted to expose my parents to lighter designers games but now we feel they&amp;#39;re capable of playing anything we would enjoy as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Majority of our games are acquired via classifieds, with gifts and new buys being the minority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Favorites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her: Sentinels of the Multiverse, Thunderstone Advance, Covert, Great Western Trail, Decrypto&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Roll Player, Dominion, Sentinels of the Multivese, Imperial Settlers, Great Western Trail, 7 Wonders Duel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Newest Games&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Clank&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Azul&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Sagrada&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Kingsforge&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Architects of the West Kingdom&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prized Possessions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Sentinels of the Multiverse big box with the drawers and room for all the expansions.  One of our first bulk purchases when we got into this included Sentinels of the Multiverse deluxe with over 50% of the expansion content, environments, etc in the box.  We fell in love with the game and picked up some of the missing content and bought the big box to hold it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife owns a woodworking shop and I aided in the construction of a custom dice tray and card holders which always get attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have / Haven&amp;#39;t played&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We make a concerted effort to rotate the games we play as much as we can so everything is played in our collection to some degree.  We do get in grooves where we fall in love with a game again that hadn&amp;#39;t been played much and go on a binge with it.  That being said there are a few games that don&amp;#39;t see too much action&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Shadowrun Crossfire: for reason listed above&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Kingdom Builder: I like it, wife hates it.  Have only played 2 player.  Thinking of trying with the parents to see if it&amp;#39;s better @ 4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Power Grid: Didn&amp;#39;t mind it but theme didn&amp;#39;t really do anything for us, no expansions.  Also only played with 2 player&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Ascension Darkness Unleashed: First Ascension game we got, but then we picked up Immortal Heroes which we prefer over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Marvel Dice Masters X-Men vs Avengers: Found the rules confusing and we&amp;#39;re not fans of direct conflict games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potentially leaving collection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Shadowrun Crossfire&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Kingdom Builder&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Ascension Darkness Unleashed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Marvel Dice Masters X-Men vs Avengers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Munchkin: Not fun with 2 players, we did finally play it with 3 but it didn&amp;#39;t get better for us.  It was an early somewhat un-research purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming Habits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife &amp;amp; I play at least a few games during the week, followed by a &amp;#39;game night&amp;#39; with my parents every weekend which usually consists of a 5 hour session of 2 heavy hitter games and 2 fillers.  This replaced a previous weekend &amp;#39;movie night&amp;#39; and we&amp;#39;re finding this a lot more entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Misc&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- My wife &amp;amp; I have near 500 logged plays each and the parents have just passed 150 plays each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- I log every possible detail to BGG (I&amp;#39;m a software engineer) and like to have as much data as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Our current gaming table is our 3 x 7&amp;#39; farmhouse dining table which we just purchased a &amp;#39;Big Viking Game Mats&amp;#39; mat for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- We have kickstarted 4 or 5 games now and enjoy helping getting these cool game designs published where they might not otherwise come into existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Shelving unit is currently an Ikea Kallax at max capacity.  Looking to add an 8 cubby unit soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have been enjoying exploring everyone&amp;#39;s collections and reading about their designer hobby experiences.  Looking forward to answering any questions you might have for us about our developing collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

While I feel that I buy a lot of games, in the grand scheme of things it's not that bad. Lots of my smaller games and stuff on the bottom shelf was found in thrift shops (besieged for 10 bux, still my best find to date).

In the next few months I'm going to cull about a quarter of this to bankroll new stuff and make space for upcoming kickstarter projects. Probably get rid of Nerath, Axis and allies, Rick and morty, broom service, and munchkin. 

**favourite games?**
It changes when I buy something new, I'll usually get super into something for a few months then move onto the next thing. Playing a lot of anachrony now but my oldest game, Betrayal at house on the hill, will probably still be my favourite 

**things I would change?**
I think I would like to get more ""smaller games.""usually i gravitate towards complex big box stuff but find i never really want to play anything of the quick games ( skyfall, munchkin, king of New York). So finding some small box big experience games may be in my future","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/9oQHk4g""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/9oQHk4g&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I feel that I buy a lot of games, in the grand scheme of things it&amp;#39;s not that bad. Lots of my smaller games and stuff on the bottom shelf was found in thrift shops (besieged for 10 bux, still my best find to date).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next few months I&amp;#39;m going to cull about a quarter of this to bankroll new stuff and make space for upcoming kickstarter projects. Probably get rid of Nerath, Axis and allies, Rick and morty, broom service, and munchkin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;favourite games?&lt;/strong&gt;
It changes when I buy something new, I&amp;#39;ll usually get super into something for a few months then move onto the next thing. Playing a lot of anachrony now but my oldest game, Betrayal at house on the hill, will probably still be my favourite &lt;/p&gt;

All’s fair as long as you’re working toward a win and all moves should be made to either optimize your chances of winning or make the game more fun. That being said, I often have “principles” in certain games connected to strategies that I feel are unfair or unfun.

Some examples include picking Zombies and Robots together in Smash Up, buying that kingdom card in Dominion Intrigue that trashes others’ cards, picking up the Union Hall in Puerto Rico’s expansion, taking the card in Above and Below that lets new workers(?) come in refreshed, or using the C-stick in smash bros. I generally will go out of my way to avoid these things even at the expense of falling behind.

Probably my biggest one comes from Munchkin. I absolutely loathe the Elf race where you can team up with someone to win a game as the Elves always just latch onto whoever is about to win for a free ride. It ruins it when everybody’s at 9 and nobody can stop the win because they blew all their cards on the last person and now an elf is helping the person win.

So one game I finally end up playing an Elf card down and manage to tag along with another play to both get our final point. We’re about to beat a monster (nobody else could stop us) and I decide to drop the player’s level one so that he’ll end with 9 points and I will get the 10 point solo win. Well he was absolutely pissed at the fact that I would do that and decides to use some sort of card to escape combat (I think you were allowed to let two players escape). I claimed that I had the choice of staying but he argued that I had to leave. We couldn’t find a rule one way or another so the table ruled that I also had to escape.

I didn’t win the game and the other player was really annoyed that I threw the game but I stuck to my guns and thought it was a fun way to use the elf card in a non-traditional way despite having a guaranteed win on the line.

(The teal-ish box on the bottom shelf contains my miniature painting supplies; I've painted a few Imperial Assault figures and they turned out okay, but I don't continue because I'm scared I'll do something wrong and ruin a mini. The Dominion box on the top shelf isn't actually Dominion, it's scenario cards for Lord of the Rings LCG. The Dominion box on the second shelf, on the other hand, is indeed Dominion.)

I try not to hold on to games I don't enjoy that much, or games that just don't get played - according to BGG I've removed 90+ games from my collection over the years, and there are some I'm trying to get rid of even now, but I don't seem to have local buyers (or maybe I'm just asking for too much) and I don't really want to deal with shipping them.

**Favorites**

* Star Wars LCG, by far the best dueling card game I've ever played. It had a unique twist on deck construction - instead of building your deck one card at a time, you get sets of 6 cards and you take all six or none - that made the game simultaneously easy to get into (okay, not really, the rules are pretty hard, but at least putting together a functional deck is easy) and yet super deep. I'm still bummed about how FFG constantly mistreated their own game and it had to die.

* Terraforming Mars, a ton of engine building fun. I love seeing my tableau and resource production grow over time, and there's a ton of variety from game to game because of that huge stack of cards (which is becoming a pain to shuffle)

* Concordia, one of the most elegant rulesets ever for a game above gateway. And I really like the way the cards determine what actions you can take and also how you score, but the two don't really align (like the prefect cards - they let you get resources for each of your trading posts in one province, so you'd like to build a lot in that province, but they score for different provinces that have you trading posts, so you also want to spread out).

**Shelf of shame** *in alphabetical order*

* Gentes

* Greenland (I've never played a Phil Eklund game yet, and the rules are scary)

* Neanderthal (same as Greenland)

* Pathfinder ACG

* Privateer (not really interested in playing it either, it just looks super dull)

* Rise to Power (same as Privateer)

* Russian Railroads (have played, just not my copy)

* Watson and Holmes

**Things I'm trying to get rid of**

* 20th Century - keeps getting overlooked and doesn't hit the table

* Alchemists - same, because in the groups I play with there's always someone who doesn't like it

* Brew Crafters - I probably own too many worker placement games

* Compounded - there's nothing exciting in this game for me

* Conan - it takes up entirely too much shelf space to be just sitting there, and the one time I tried it we spent like 5 hours on one scenario

* Founders of Gloomhaven - slightly more convoluted than it needed to be

* Legacy: Gears of Time - the theme is cool, but gameplay is kind of meh

* One Night Ultimate Werewolf - I've had fun with it, but decided I prefer Avalon or Spyfall when I want quick social deduction; ONUW is just a bit too chaotic

* Privateer - got it from KS after insane delays, but now that it's here it just looks boring, so I haven't even tried it

* Templar Intrigue - not my thing

* This War of Mine - I actually don't mind having it and wouldn't mind playing a second time, but I feel like I should be able to sell this for a pretty penny, and that's better than a game that isn't getting played

**Incoming kickstarters**

* 7th Continent + expansion

* Alhambra designer's edition (I've played basic Alhambra a few times, and it's a neat gateway-ish game)

* Anachrony Infinity box (I've played Anachrony and it's cool, and this box and its contents look super pretty, and 
I'm a sucker for pretty games; also, the modules bring in more ways to screw with time and I wanted to see how those work)

* Awkward Guests

* Blood Rage digital KS extras - I missed the original Blood Rage KS, but I do enjoy the game a lot

* Chocolate Factory

* In the Hall of the Mountain King

* It's a Wonderful World

* Kingdom Rush

* Petrichor + expansion

* Shipwreck Arcana

* Terraforming Mars: Turmoil - I couldn't exactly say no to more TM, at least not when I'm somene who likes to play with all the current expansions

* Tiny Epic Mechs

* Town Builder: Coevorden - honestly I don't remember much about this one; can only hope it's good

* Villagers - should be shipping to me sometime in the near future

**Upcoming purchases** *I like to make few big purchases, and the next one is in three weeks or so, so I'm planning to get a few from this list then*

* Abyss - played once, had a blast

* Concordia Venus - I'm thinking about grabbing the standalone one and selling the old base game just so I don't have to worry about lid lift when I put everything in there

* Downforce, possibly - I've only played once and had fun, but I should probably talk this one over with my girlfriend because I'd be likely to play it with her

* Keyper - played it once two years ago or so, and fell in love

* Orleans - mostly because my girlfriend says I should; a friend has a copy and it'd be enough for me to just play Orleans when he's there, but she wants to play it at other times too

* Palaces of Carrara - I did super badly with picking my scoring times the two times I played, but I'd like to try some more

* Underwater Cities - a lot of card play and engine building here, and I love both of those things","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/gallery/MJWWxGi""&gt;https://imgur.com/gallery/MJWWxGi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

[**Page in manga where they start playing Settlers of Catan**](https://imgur.com/dkYrg3X)

&amp;#x200B;

It follows 3 girls at first: the shy girl who is kind of a loner, who then meets the new upbeat transfer student, who then both follow the class president and discover she works at a FLGS.

&amp;#x200B;

The 3 start playing board games together, with the first being Marrakech. (In later chapters they play games like Cockroach Poker, Incan Gold, and eventually Catan)

&amp;#x200B;

The manga has 19 chapters so far, and it's very light on plot, as the game is honestly just a wholesome story about these girls diving into the board gaming hobby.

A little background, we have a fairly small group of 8-9 people who are grad students in the US and play different board games weekly. We mostly play Catan along with some other smaller games like One-night werewolf, codenames, etc.   


We have been playing Concordia for the last few months and till now we have played around 4-5 games, each time with either 3 or 5 players. We are confused about the variation of outcome in the game and whether we are using the correct strategies or not. In all our games, the outcome is only decided by whoever is holding maximum Minerva cards. We end the game with somewhat closer scores, varying by at max 10-15 points.  


We understand the eventual goal here is to maximize cities, provinces covered, resource types generated, colonists and obviously card building. In all our matches, we have played very well balanced because our strategies were mostly defined, generate resource, generate money, build cities or buy cards. All of our games end with most of everyone's cities on board, and the card stack mostly depleted.  


When we count the scores, the only thing that makes the winning player seems to be the Minerva card. Whoever buys the Minerva cards either wins or at least becomes 2nd. This has become so prominent that now when we play, from the very beginning, the first player (if not, the next one) jumps for the Minerva cards at any costs needed. Because, if in the end, everyone covers all resources and has most cities on board, then only the Minerva cards (3X, 5X multipliers) are the only game changer.  

Are we doing something wrong? The game is already getting very monotonous for us because of this lack of randomness. We have tried other strategies (like getting more colonists out along with buying Mars cards) that do not include buying Minerva cards, but it is hard to beat the score multipliers. At least in Catan, the outcome changes because of the dices.

&lt;p&gt;Are we doing something wrong? The game is already getting very monotonous for us because of this lack of randomness. We have tried other strategies (like getting more colonists out along with buying Mars cards) that do not include buying Minerva cards, but it is hard to beat the score multipliers. At least in Catan, the outcome changes because of the dices.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t want to presume the game mechanism being bad since it is rated so high in BoardGameGeek.&lt;/p&gt;

I purchased **DoW:TLN** a few weeks ago. I mostly game solo and occasionally play with my boyfriend. Sadly, all my DoW:TLN games have been solo so far. I find it excessively easy, even when it's on the hardcore side, because there is no betrayer, no secret objectives and no crossroads card. 

I found a DoW solo variant (family first) on bgg and I found it a lot more fun. I think if I ramp up the difficulty on the solo variant, it could be quite a challenge and quite enjoyable. 

My current dilemma is that I saw a copy of DoW:Crossroads on sale (second hand) for 30 CAD and I'm wondering whether or not I should snatch it up to compliment my TLN.

We will continuously look at submitted suggestions for and potentially print and publish such contributions. As such the game will be modular, and some of the earlier expansions will be transformed into modules.

* High Frontier 4 All: Core Game (Basic and Advanced Game) - Dom Rougier + Phil and Jon
* Module 0: Politics (probably incl. in the Core box for KS) - Justin Grey + Phil

* Module II: Colonists: Colonization &amp; Bernals - Jeff Chamberlain + Phil
* [MAYBE] Module III: Space Diamonds - Jon + Phil
* [MAYBE] Module IV: - A module by Pawel Garycki + Phi

My partner and I started by buying **Pandemic** on the advice of our FLGS to kill a snowy evening in 2017 when friends were in town.

From there it snowballed. I purchased **Catan**, remembering it as a super-heavy euro from my youth. Next, **Eldritch Horror**, and the rest is history.

I’d like to find a few more thinky 2-player games, and maybe a grand 4X or even 18XX experience.

I’d happily never touch **Time Stories** or **Mice &amp; Mystics** ever again... in both cases, the gorgeous artwork, and (to me) inspired design just couldn’t save an absolute slog of a game, with underwhelming finishes.

I can’t wait to try **Who Goes There**!

My top few right now are **Lords of Vegas**, **Skull**, **Sushi Go Party**, **Great Western Trail**, and a custom **Bohnanza** I had manufactured for my father-in-law, swapping beans for the Topps baseball cards he collected as a kid.

Not pictured are the usual suspects, Risk, various Monopolies, Twister, Mad Gab etc.

Thanks for looking!

How long have I been into the hobby? I’ve been into tabletop games for almost 30 years. I got hooked with DnD, HeroQuest, Battlemasters, and Risk as a kid. Now that I make good money and my kids are involved, it just gives me a reason to continue on with it.

What would I change about my collection? I really wouldn’t change anything about my physical collection. I AM changing my habits of playing more of what I have instead of buying more of what I might play in the future. Between my various circles of friends, I try to introduce a new game each week.

I don't even know if this is the right place to share my doubts, since it has a board, but the cards are the main part of the game. In short, for those of you who don't know the game (if you do, skip this paragraph), you have a deck of cards that have really beautiful unique drawings. Each player gets 6 cards. One person at a time will give a theme about one of the cards they have, and all the others chose one of theirs that they think fits the theme. The players then have to guess which cards was given by the person who chose the theme. You are supposed to give a theme so that at least one person votes on the right card, but not everyone.

We have been playing it so often that we are running out of good ideas. I bought an extension to the main deck, and now we play with both at the same time (mixed), which brings new ideas to the table, but also makes it hard to choose good themes, since it's harder to predict which cards the other players have.

And now, my doubts begin:

1- are we supposed to not use both decks at the same time, for the reason that I just mentioned?

2- is it ok to make a theme that you know only one of your friends will get? (like referencing a song only you know, a TV series you know only he has watched) and what about one that every player but one can understand?

3- should we just keep it to more abstract things, like feelings and ideals, or any kind of thing is valid? (implied that this doesn't colide with the previous question)

4- I have been trying to make rounds with specific rules (like ""every theme must be about a person/character"", ""every theme must be the name of one of the present players"", ""every theme must say the exact opposite of what's happening on the card""). I feel like it will create more opportunities to the issues raised in 2 to happen, but it also seems like a good way to keep the game fresh. They don't appear to be as willing to change it as much as I am, but I have been playing DixIt for years, before I showed them the game.

Discord is a pretty amazing platform where you can chat about your hobby and daily struggles, make friends, play games and many many more. It also serves as a Voip app so you don't need any other software other than Discord to get in touch with your newly made friends or play games together.

&amp;#x200B;

We want Playingoffline to be a place to, discuss board games, comic books, video games, miniatures and share your work, project, get feedback, or even engage in meetups (AZ, US) and conventions, maybe play online too.

We have channels for designers too, so you can showcase your games and maybe reach some potential customer's.

In all honesty, I'm a bit disappointed at how many people missed the point of my post here. I just wanted to share a little bit of positive enthusiasm for the guys and girls who demo games at cons. Highlight them for the awesome pillars of the community that they are, and it seems that about 5% of you are really annoyed about it. Hopefully, we can all agree that conventions are awesome, board games are awesome, and we all want more people to be awesome.

With that said, I will no longer be replying to comments that verbally abuse me or call me names.

May your rolls be ever critical.

Edit 1: So it has become quite apparent that I need to clarify a few things:

- I know that this is not a particularly bad experience. It's supposed to be an example, not some kind of sympathy drive. I too have worked the hellhole that is retail and service. I've had people yell in my face, spit at me, try to fight me, all because they got sold the wrong cable or received a dirty glass. I just don't want some poor unsuspecting kid to have their first experiences of working at a convention be wrecked by one of these people.

- The example interaction was not a jokey, flirty exchange of banter. It was an adult human yelling at me. I don't care that she yelled at me. In fact, I laughed at her with the next group of people who approached the booth. The tale serves to illustrate my point. It is not supposed to be a story of the most traumatic experience of my thirties.

You don't need to tell me how sensitive I am or how terrible you have it at [Insert Retail Outlet Here]. However, if it makes you feel better to get it off your chest, please go ahead.

**Original Post**

I've been to my fair share of cons, but last weekend was my first time seeing them from the other side of the bar. I had a blast, met some awesome people and got my ass kicked at Star Realms. It was a truly awesome experience.

However, I was honestly shocked at the way some people spoke to my fellow demonstrators and wanted to bring this up here and perhaps clear up a few things.

First off, here is an actual interaction I had with an attendee.

It was the busiest day of the convention and our game had already booked up all of its demo slots by mid-morning. Unfortunately, that meant I had to disappoint a lot of people, most of whom were really cool about it and many of whom remarked on how awesome it was that we were so popular. It was at this point that an American Lady approached us.

Me = Me / AL = American Lady

AL: ""Hi, I'd like to book a slot for your game""

Me: ""I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid we're fully booked up for the whole day, but...""

AL: ""Can I book one for tomorrow then?""

Me: ""Once again, really sorry, but we're only taking on-the-day bookings to give single day ticket holders a fair chance at getting a game. If you come back early tomorrow, I can book you in.""

AL: ""So I'm not special enough to book for tomorrow then?""

Me: ""Nobody is. The only fair way to go about this is to treat everybody equally, but if you...""

AL: ""I see how it is"" *proceeds to storm away in a tantrum*

I wish this was an isolated incident, but it was by no means the only time I saw this kind of interaction.

I realise most of you already know this and I'm effectively preaching to the choir, but the demo guys at conventions are almost all volunteers, giving up their whole weekend to add a little bit of variety to your con. You don't need to thank them, after all, they want to be there, but at least be nice to them.

This kind of behaviour is not cool when visited upon actual paid employees, but it's really quite indefensible to speak to a volunteer like that. I'd hate to think that some bright-eyed, young, first-time demonstrator might be put off of ever volunteering again because some mean attendee made them feel like crap.

I get it. It's humid, stuffy, noisy in the hall. You've just had to re-mortgage your apartment to afford an overpriced cheeseburger and a cup of stale coffee, and now that game you really wanted to try out is denied you, despite you paying a fair bit of cash for a ticket to attend, but it isn't anyone's fault.

It certainly isn't the fault of the happy, smiling nerd who would have informed you that the whole team had volunteered to run games in a local bar all evening for those who were disappointed, had you only let him finish any of his sentences.

In the words of Bill S. Preston, ""be excellent to each other"".","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: So it seems I now need to address the fact that I referred to our lovely antagonist as &amp;#39;American Lady&amp;#39;. I&amp;#39;m sorry to any Americans I offended with this description. Being the only American lady I met all weekend at a convention that wasn&amp;#39;t in America, I have to admit that being American was her defining feature. My journalistic instincts got the better of me on this one. I feel it&amp;#39;s important to point out that the passionate patriotism that is often seen as a big part of American culture isn&amp;#39;t really a thing over here, so pointing out that a person doing crappy things is American didn&amp;#39;t even cross my mind as offensive, at least not until today.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

**Mistakes**

&amp;#x200B;

**Games we've released back into the wild:**

* Quoridor - Gorgeous &amp; Brilliant, but too chesslike. Abstract Strategy seems to collect dust)
* Santorini - Beautiful components, great mechanics, didn't know we HATE Abstract Strategy)
* Stratego: 50 Years - A childhood game I adored, but... Abstract Strategy. Are you seeing a pattern?)
* Ticket To Ride: New York - Not enough choices to make. Great for kids.
* Pandemic Legacy: Season 1 - Never played. Sat on the shelf for a whole year. All the hype in the world just couldn't make that game look interesting to us, I guess.
* Lost Cities - Too Simple. Felt like a waste of time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Games we'll be selling from our collection:**

* Age of War (2014) - Way too much luck! Made a home made expansion to make it more fun.
* Carcassonne (2000) - Great for it's time, like the Beatles.
* Eight-Minute Empire (2012) - Fantastic for what it is, but a little too ""travel-game"" for us.
* Flip Ships (2017) - We prefer Strategy to Dexterity, but still an Awesome Game!
* Game of Thrones: Hand of the King (2016) - Abstract Strategy. when will I learn?
* Jamaica (2007) - It's a wonderful family game, just not what we were looking for.
* NMBR 9 (2014) - Too simple for us.
* Rising 5: Runes of Asteros (2017) - Beautiful Dutrait Art, and cool mechanics, but low replay-ability.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

**Realizations**

&amp;#x200B;

**Find what YOU Like/Dislike:** All the reviews in the world won't give you 100% a purchase success rate. You don't know what you like and don't like until you play it. Part of the learning curve of Board Gaming is making purchase mistakes and learning from them. I didn't even know what Abstract Strategy was, until one day I thought ""Hey, all these games I dislike are kind of chesslike..."" or that I seemed to love a certain amount of options, or that I seem to care about the component's art more than most, or that I love multiplayer solitaire with just a little ""take that"".

&amp;#x200B;

**Don't RELY on Reviews:** BGG and Reviewers might point you in the right direction, but ultimately, if you want to know if you will like a game, watch it being played, or play it yourself. Hearing an overview of it's mechanics aren't enough to know if you will find them satisfying.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pace yourself:** If you're anything like me, you want to buy way more than you can play. A lot of us are collectors by nature, and that can really hurt finances and even make you resent the hobby. I made a couple of rules to keep my collector-nature at bay and to motivate me to pay more. I realize that **these rules aren't for everyone**, but they are perfect for us.

In order to buy a new game:

1. **No Shelf of Shame:** Each game in your collection should have been played at least 1 time.
2. **10 Plays:** At least 10 plays of any games between each purchase.
3. **25 Max:** 25 Games Max in your collection. (If you want something new, sell something you aren't playing.)

&amp;#x200B;

**Stop looking at SALES:** Do you want a shelf full of the games you truly want to play, or the games you can get a good deal on? It can be SO HARD to turn down a game at half price, but if it's not at the top of your list, you are ultimately going to be disappointed with your collection.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wingspan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Istanbul&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bruges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concordia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nusfjord&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raiders Of The North Sea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grand Austrian Hotel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alien Frontiers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cuba&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ulm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistakes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Games we&amp;#39;ve released back into the wild:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quoridor - Gorgeous &amp;amp; Brilliant, but too chesslike. Abstract Strategy seems to collect dust)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Santorini - Beautiful components, great mechanics, didn&amp;#39;t know we HATE Abstract Strategy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stratego: 50 Years - A childhood game I adored, but... Abstract Strategy. Are you seeing a pattern?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ticket To Ride: New York - Not enough choices to make. Great for kids.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pandemic Legacy: Season 1 - Never played. Sat on the shelf for a whole year. All the hype in the world just couldn&amp;#39;t make that game look interesting to us, I guess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lost Cities - Too Simple. Felt like a waste of time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Games we&amp;#39;ll be selling from our collection:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Age of War (2014) - Way too much luck! Made a home made expansion to make it more fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carcassonne (2000) - Great for it&amp;#39;s time, like the Beatles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eight-Minute Empire (2012) - Fantastic for what it is, but a little too &amp;quot;travel-game&amp;quot; for us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flip Ships (2017) - We prefer Strategy to Dexterity, but still an Awesome Game!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Game of Thrones: Hand of the King (2016) - Abstract Strategy. when will I learn?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jamaica (2007) - It&amp;#39;s a wonderful family game, just not what we were looking for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NMBR 9 (2014) - Too simple for us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rising 5: Runes of Asteros (2017) - Beautiful Dutrait Art, and cool mechanics, but low replay-ability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Realizations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find what YOU Like/Dislike:&lt;/strong&gt; All the reviews in the world won&amp;#39;t give you 100% a purchase success rate. You don&amp;#39;t know what you like and don&amp;#39;t like until you play it. Part of the learning curve of Board Gaming is making purchase mistakes and learning from them. I didn&amp;#39;t even know what Abstract Strategy was, until one day I thought &amp;quot;Hey, all these games I dislike are kind of chesslike...&amp;quot; or that I seemed to love a certain amount of options, or that I seem to care about the component&amp;#39;s art more than most, or that I love multiplayer solitaire with just a little &amp;quot;take that&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#39;t RELY on Reviews:&lt;/strong&gt; BGG and Reviewers might point you in the right direction, but ultimately, if you want to know if you will like a game, watch it being played, or play it yourself. Hearing an overview of it&amp;#39;s mechanics aren&amp;#39;t enough to know if you will find them satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pace yourself:&lt;/strong&gt; If you&amp;#39;re anything like me, you want to buy way more than you can play. A lot of us are collectors by nature, and that can really hurt finances and even make you resent the hobby. I made a couple of rules to keep my collector-nature at bay and to motivate me to pay more. I realize that &lt;strong&gt;these rules aren&amp;#39;t for everyone&lt;/strong&gt;, but they are perfect for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to buy a new game:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Shelf of Shame:&lt;/strong&gt; Each game in your collection should have been played at least 1 time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 Plays:&lt;/strong&gt; At least 10 plays of any games between each purchase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25 Max:&lt;/strong&gt; 25 Games Max in your collection. (If you want something new, sell something you aren&amp;#39;t playing.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop looking at SALES:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you want a shelf full of the games you truly want to play, or the games you can get a good deal on? It can be SO HARD to turn down a game at half price, but if it&amp;#39;s not at the top of your list, you are ultimately going to be disappointed with your collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

Some games sure,  4 is a good limit to keep costs down (extra player boards, tokens etc) but certain games it would be super easy just to change a couple small rules to have an extra player.

The upcoming release of Machina arcana is like this. The game is 1-4 players, but a stretch goal is a PDF player board. The game scales simply by adding extra enemy spawn rolls per player.  

But I get it, length is an issue too.

Just the skull tokens are pictured. What would be the rose tokens are just plain blank chips. 

Skull is one of my absolute favorite games to break out at the bar with my gaming group and as a way to bring non-gamers into our circle.

One evening we met some friends at one of the local breweries, and needless to say one of the players refused to treat the components with respect, and had rubbed the ever-loving crap out of it, scuffing it up (as seen in the album). So, Skull sat on the shelf for a while so I could ignore the fact that it was damaged. Another friend had a copy that was ruined by small children, and so I decided that I wanted to make an inexpensive and more durable solution for us.

I ordered an inexpensive set of Cardinal poker chips from Amazon (\~$8), borrowed a container of Mod Podge from a friend and printed some skull icons on my printer. I cut out the icons using a small Xacto knife and then just put a couple layers of mod podge on the top to protect them. From that cheap set of poker chips I was able to make 6 sets of Skull tokens with 5 different colors. All-in-all, less than $10 worth of materials and 1 hour of my time.

Best part? They're damn-near indestructible. Not only are they rub-proof, but spill-proof and their small size makes it super easy to put in the car and take with me. If I lose a piece I just replace it easily with another chip. I'd highly recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive alternative!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Album here (graphic imagery of ruined game components, fair warning!):  &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/Kqo2Nwt""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/Kqo2Nwt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I know this doesn't sound like a problem in general, but was hoping the experienced and wise here could help me out. Basically, I formed a group with a partner (the main host) of a friend of a friend of my wife (it was hard to find gamers in my circle!). It was just 3 of us initially but since a lot of games that we wanted to try out had 4 players, the host added his friend to the group on our second meetup. We all got along and we had a blast so he became a fixture. Then the host added another dude who was also cool but he kinda likes playing one type of game. Anyway Im cool with that (well not really but cool enough because he gets into the games and really amps up the fun factor). So then he also became a fixture because it turns out him and the host were old childhood friends who have reconnected over these game sessions, which im happy for. 

Now for the upcoming sessions I just found out the host just invited another 2 of his friends to join. Now here's the part I find tricky: since im the one supplying 95% of the games we play, do I have any say in determining how big the group gets? The host is the one hosting all sessions because he lives most centrally and does not have a car (and they're all his friends). 

Am I being selfish for trying to keep the group sizes down just so we can play certain games? Perhaps I should be more altruistic and see the larger benefits of social bonding? I've voiced some concerns about the player count but the host brushed it off by saying he can sit it out and share hands but I don't think that would be ideal. Should I just put up and shut up or is there something I can do? Im not a confrontational person so telling the host directly I want him to stop inviting more people would be difficult. Minor point - apart from me, the rest of the group share a long history and I tend to feel left out when they start talking non-game things.

Anyway thanks so much for reading and I hope to hear your own experiences and advice.

I recently brought it back to my apartment from home after not playing it for easily 10 years and got it to the table tonight with 3 other people that had never played it. 

God I forgot how cutthroat this game can get while being a very lighthearted game at the same time. The game started out calmly as we placed the river but quickly a large city began to be fought over by all but one of us. The game consisted of primarily vying for single ownership of the massive (what ended up being a 30 point city) city while our 4th player just went about making and completing small cities and monestaries. By the time the mega city was complete there were a total of 5 meeples from 3 different players returned to people's hands with two of us getting points for the city. Once the city was taken care of, control over the farmland was next as it was pretty much one continuous farm that touched almost every completed city. Up until the last tile was placed it was up in the air over who would be crowned master farmer (the player who ended up with control over the farm got 24 points from 8 cities.) 

Not really sure why I stopped playing the game so long ago but I was certainly reminded of how much fun it can be to flip tiles and see if you can screw over your friends who are trying to take over your city.

I recently brought it back to my apartment from home after not playing it for easily 10 years and got it to the table tonight with 3 other people that had never played it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God I forgot how cutthroat this game can get while being a very lighthearted game at the same time. The game started out calmly as we placed the river but quickly a large city began to be fought over by all but one of us. The game consisted of primarily vying for single ownership of the massive (what ended up being a 30 point city) city while our 4th player just went about making and completing small cities and monestaries. By the time the mega city was complete there were a total of 5 meeples from 3 different players returned to people&amp;#39;s hands with two of us getting points for the city. Once the city was taken care of, control over the farmland was next as it was pretty much one continuous farm that touched almost every completed city. Up until the last tile was placed it was up in the air over who would be crowned master farmer (the player who ended up with control over the farm got 24 points from 8 cities.) &lt;/p&gt;

**Description from Boardgamegeek**:

Description from the publisher:

After being stripped of all their possessions, a mage, a warrior, an elf, and a dwarf are forced to go rob the local Magic Maze shopping mall for all the equipment necessary for their next adventure. They agree to map out the labyrinth in its entirety first, then find each individual’s favorite store, and then locate the exit. In order to evade the surveillance of the guards who eyed their arrival suspiciously, all four will pull off their heists simultaneously, then dash to the exit. That's the plan anyway…but can they pull it off?

Magic Maze is a real-time, cooperative game. Each player can control any hero in order to make that hero perform a very specific action, to which the other players do not have access: Move north, explore a new area, ride an escalator… All this requires rigorous cooperation between the players in order to succeed at moving the heroes prudently. However, you are allowed to communicate only for short periods during the game; the rest of the time, you must play without giving any visual or audio cues to each other. If all of the heroes succeed in leaving the shopping mall in the limited time allotted for the game, each having stolen a very specific item, then everyone wins together.

At the start of the game, you have only three minutes in which to take actions. Hourglass spaces you encounter along the way give you more time. If the sand timer ever completely runs out, all players lose the game: Your loitering has aroused suspicion, and the mall security guards nab you!

I have always had a love for board games, but never knew the vast world of what was out there until about 8 months ago.  Me and my wife bought a house and wanted a fun way to host events so we started having game nights.  First with Jackbox games, and the Nintendo Switch then started playing CAH (ugh IK, ive come a long ways from there) Resistance, and Ultimate Werewolf.  It was then that I found this subreddit, which then led to Youtube, then to Podcasts and it's all downhill from there!

 “How long have you been involved in the hobby?” 
Ive played a lot of party/social deduction games since I was in high school, thanks to my sister, but I would have to say I've really dove in 7 months ago when I went all in and got Spirit Island.  Probably not the best game to get right of the bat, but I watched a lot of tutorials and fell in love right away!

“What would you change about your collection if you could?” 
Cards Against Humanity, and Dear Lord need to go.  Not great games now that I have ventured out lol

My favorite game here lately has been Railroad Ink, Deception: Murder in Hong Kong, and Spirit Island.

My newest game is Railroad Ink.  This one is a lot of fun, and gets a play through just about every morning over a cup of coffee.  Its also the game I attribute to my wife becoming more interested in board games, so thats a plus!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/7qibr01""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/7qibr01&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I’m looking to get either Terra Mystica or Gaia Project and I’m pretty torn on which to go for.

For those who played both - would it be best to get Terra Mystica first and go for Gaia Project later (as sort of an “expansion”)? That seems to be how most people got exposed to GP. Or just dive straight into GP, which on the balance sounds like the better game (for most)?

I'll give my favorite two.

[Jaipur](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/54043/jaipur): a 2 player set collection situation where at the start of the game both players are looking at nearly all the points available, and trying to grab up as much of those points as they can. The race is created because by waiting around, you could potentially earn some extra points not included in the zero sum set up, but by striking first you could get bigger points for acting quickly, while at the same time denying those bigger points to your opponent who may be caught on the backfoot because they felt they were better positioned than you to score in that set. It's a game all about timing. While being lucky helps, a keen sense of knowing when to strike can mitigate a lot.

[Hostage Negotiator](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/134253/hostage-negotiator): A very clever design that somehow gets away with using a zero sum point scoring mechanic in a 1 player game. At the start of the game the hostage taker has taken x number of hostages, and it's up to you to save as many as you can as quickly as you can, before the unstable hostage taker kills a number greater than or equal to half of x (although x may have increased in value by this time depending on events.) There is a lot I could say about why I like this game, and I will say that my enjoyment of it definitely increased once I started winning a bit more regularly. The one thing I'll note here, is that typically when I play solitaire games, I never think of myself as playing against an opponent, even if the solitaire version is described as being a ""bot."" I mostly think of the events not directly controlled by me as being luck events I'm having to respond to.  I find I win more often and have more fun when I think in these terms. When I play chess against my phone, I actually DO think of my phone as being something like an intelligent opponent. Even though philosophically I know it's not, in order for me to make the best moves I'm able, it's best if I pretend as though it's an intelligent agent reacting to my moves with designs and plans to foil me. Perhaps if I were in the ballpark of intellect of [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turochamp) I would more easily be able to get that sort of experience from a table top game. The reason I bring all this up, is just to compliment Hostage Negotiator on integrating the theme so well into the mechanics, that I sometimes DO feel as though I'm playing against an opponent, and sometimes even win while trying to understand and keep my ""opponents"" motives in mind. There's so much dice involved that this could be chalked up to coincidence, but it makes for a fun experience either way.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently this a pretty important concept in game theory and economics, so what are some of your favorite modern takes on using a Zero Sum &amp;quot;point accumulation&amp;quot; objective to create tension and drive excitement in a game?

The reason I bring all this up, is just to compliment Hostage Negotiator on integrating the theme so well into the mechanics, that I sometimes DO feel as though I&amp;#39;m playing against an opponent, and sometimes even win while trying to understand and keep my &amp;quot;opponents&amp;quot; motives in mind. There&amp;#39;s so much dice involved that this could be chalked up to coincidence, but it makes for a fun experience either way.&lt;/p&gt;

Indeed, it is amazing to think that a lightweight engine builder about birds could generate so much demand and fighting among retailers and Stonemaier games. Instantly selling out as soon as it copies comes in, what is behind the urge, the need, to own this game?

**Concept/Theme** – The idea behind Wingspan is simple. You want to add or collect birds to your aviary. And it is a theme that comes out well in the game, though I would say it is more due to the production quality than the mechanics itself. As stated, the game is a lightweight engine builder and your goal is simple, collect enough birds, eggs and assorted food or cards above or under the birds, and complete your goals to win the game. All the cards are “unique” in the game, but that might be a bit of an exaggeration as most share broad elements with other cards and you see special powers repeat often. That said, the theme is a unique one or at least rare, and has appeal far outside of just bird watchers.

**Gameplay** – Gameplay is straightforward and consists of placing an action cube on one of 4 rows and taking that action. The 4 actions are basic at the beginning. You can play a bird, get food, lay eggs, or draw a card. That’s the core of the game, at least at the beginning. However, there is a cascading effect as you play, like any good engine builder should allow. Playing birds down each action column gets progressively more expensive but allows each of the lower rows to get more powerful. While you can only claim 1 food at the start of the game (chosen from among 5 dice rolled), you can later possibly get up to 3 food (4 if you discard). Laying eggs works the same, 2 at the start, but ultimately up to 4 or 5. Drawing cards works the same way.

In addition, playing the bird cards in their selected habitats (Woods/Food, Plains/Eggs, Wetlands/Draw Cards) can grant you additional abilities. Some get you instant effects, some will trigger every time you select the action row they are in, and some will trigger based on actions your opponents will take (but only once between turns). This makes planning out what combos you want vitally important, but also leads to the games lightweight status and its greatest weakness, which I’ll touch on in a moment.

Lastly, you have bonus cards. You start with 2 and select one of them, choosing one to keep. They are all generally collect X of Y style cards, giving you 3-4 points for a certain amount of birds, then closer to 8ish points if you have 5 or 6 or more of them. Furthermore, a fair amount of birds allow you to draw 2 more bonus cards, keeping one, giving you more clusters of points to aim for.

Each round also has a goal (there are 4 rounds) and the player who accomplishes the goal best gets the most points, with 2nd place getting less, third and fourth possibly getting none at all. There are two sides to the goal board as well, one that gives a friendly range of points from 5 to 1, dropping 1 point for each place. For more competitive people, you can try the other side, where points drop off much faster and may leave 3rd through 5th with no points at all. Regardless, at the end of each round, each player will place one of their action cubes on the space they placed at, leaving them with one less action to take each round, meaning each action becomes more and more valuable towards the end of the game.

At the end of the 4th round, players will total their points. Each bird played is worth a certain value, and players count their goal bonuses, bonus cards, cards tucked under their birds, and the number of eggs/food on top of their bird cards to see who won. A nice double-sided scorecard is provided, allowing easy tracking of a ton of games.

**Art/Aesthetics** – This is the wow factor to the game without a doubt. The linen feel rule book, the high-quality cards, the nice plastic cases for your bits, the wooden dice, the book style folding player boards and the opulent dice tower, the game sings of overproduction. Actually, I have never liked that word. Overproduction makes it sound like it is better made than it should be, but honestly, I wish almost all board games were of the quality that came in this box. Costs must be maintained, obviously, but if there is one thing Stonemaier games has to be proud of, it is how good their production values are.

https://imgur.com/a/OPdWaQL

The artwork for the bird cards, each unique, looks like it was pulled straight out of Autoban’s personal collection. The player boards are nice quality, and the dice tower, though clunky due to it loading the dice from the back, makes the game a stunner on the table. All in all, this is what I wish all board games looked like, in terms of production (but not style).

**Final Opinion** – Wingspan really is a fantastic game, and one that my wife and I both really enjoy. Our son could care less about it because of its theming, which I do understand. That however isn’t the one real flaw of the game, and what limits it in my opinion. It’s the lack of choice.

I love choice in games, even games with a fair amount of randomness should allow for meaningful choices and this here is the stumbling block I have with Wingspan. To illustrate this point, I’m going to briefly talk about two other engine builders I really enjoy, one lightweight, one heavier.

**Gizmos** is another game that looks great on the table. Your engine is built in the game by buying cards laid out on the table that, in turn, will affect the actions you are allowed to take, sometimes causing huge combo’s and chains that trigger over multiple actions. You are primarily limited by how much energy you have (and can have), what you can research, and what cards are showing. The game, however, offers you plenty of choice. You can reserve (hold) a card (later, perhaps multiple cards) that you cannot build right now. You have 3 rows of cards, 4 tier one, 3 tier two, and 2 tier 3 cards, offering you a selection of 9 cards to select from. Researching will allow you to pick any one of the tiers as well and research (draw) 3 cards (and potentially more) from that pile and select one to reserve or build immediately. So, while there is randomness in the game and the exact card you want may not be out, there is a wide variety of options to always draw from. A wide field of choice informs your gameplay.

**Terraforming Mars** is another game, maybe not a stunner on the table, that is all about building your engine. Almost everything is about the cards here (or standard projects, but anyone can do those at any time, if they can pay for them). You get a large hand of 10 cards at the start of the game to choose from. You do have to pay for them, but it is likely you wouldn’t want all of them anyway. Every generation (round) after that, you will draw 4 new cards to add to those that you have. Many players prefer to draft these, giving more nuance and strategy to the game by making you choose what to keep and what to risk giving to another player. While there are more ways to get cards, these are the primary ways to get them and you will receive a steady stream of cards throughout the game, forcing some hard choices. An expansion, **Prelude**, gives you even more choice by letting you choose 2 Prelude cards (from a hand of 4) that give you not only an early boost, but a possible focus to work towards, based on your starting hand. Again, it’s all about the choices and the number of cards, informing your gameplay.

Wingspan, on the other hand, starts you with 5, and you must pay your food to keep them, on a 1:1 basis. After that, a total of 3 cards will be available to draw if you choose the Draw action (and the draw pile of course, which is a blind draw). These 3 do not refill if you take one of them, forcing you to always be limited to only 3 cards. In addition, at the start of the game, taking a Draw action will only net you 1 card, and at a maximum, if you fill the row with birds, possibly 4 (if you pay extra for the 4th, otherwise 3). This keeps your hand very tight and small, and the only 3 cards visible severely restricts your choice.

This isn’t necessarily bad game design, nor am I claiming it as such, as it prevents players from making perfect engines, instead making the players adjust to what is available or the luck of the draw. I actually enjoy this aspect, as the game never lets you feel like you have an excess of anything. Unlike the games I mentioned earlier, where by the end of the game you feel you are getting tons of stuff, Wingspan goes from feeling starved to merely full, without any bloat generally. I find that a plus, generally.

However, and this is a big however and a limiting factor of the game, is that because resources and cards tend to be so limited to choose from and so tight, a starting hand that clicks together can give a player a massive head start over a players hand is a mishmash, and since there is a set number of turns and rounds in the game, that lead might be insurmountable, skill for skill with no chance to overcome it.

But, Wingspan is a lighter game and because of that, I feel it can get away with that. It joins the ranks of games like Ascension, where the random nature of the card play can greatly, through sheer luck, favor one player over the other. I still recommend it for anyone into the theme, or anyone looking for a beautiful, well produced game that plays in under an hour (maybe not with 4, but easily for 2-3) that works really well. It’s not perfect, and it probably doesn’t deserve the hype and attention level it has gotten, but for anyone looking for something family weight, you won’t go wrong with this game. If you can find it, that is.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is a game that has recently caused more controversy than Wingspan this year, I cannot think of one.

https://imgur.com/a/uQQAh8P

I started the hobby about 13 years ago when I was at my local FLGS (that I still go to today) and picked up Arkham Horror 2nd Ed.

I really enjoy quite a range of game types, but deckbuilders and RPGs are probably my favorites.

* Favorite Game: Summoner Wars
* War Game: War of the Ring
* RPG: Middara (So far!)
* Family Game: Azul/Mysterium
* Cooperative: Arkham Horror
* Engine Builder: Space Base
* Card: Summoner Wars/Star Realms
* Party Game: Rumble in the Dungeon (House rules!)

Honestly I'd like to get rid of a lot of the games that no longer see play, but a lot are gifted and that always feels bad to sell off for me. 

Ascension is one that I'd clear out once I find a home, played it a ton for a long time but other deckbuilders have come and are much better IMO.

I'll definitely be picking up the Middara KS this month and Tiny Towns once I've had a few more plays of some other games.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally got two shelves setup in the entertainment room and all the games out of various storage solutions. &lt;/p&gt;

The [Alfonso X](https://premiosalfonsox.geekout.com.ar/) awards have been going on for a few years now, as a means to push the (rather small) local industry to go a bit further and make nice games for everyone. This year I'm lucky to volunteer with the [group that organizes it](http://geekout.com.ar) and got to play all the games competing this year. I thought it might be nice to share my thoughts with the world now that the finalists (and some other promising games that didn't make it this year) have been announced :)

Of course all opinions here are my own and I have no clue how this award will turn out! My job as a volunteer is to collaborate in the group's YouTube channel and I've got nothing to do with the awards jury.

Without further ado, dem games:

# Fast Food

(2-10 players, 15min, [bgg entry](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/257080/fast-food))

It's a really fast-paced game of pattern recognition. You have custom dies to throw with different hamburger components (bread, tomato, lettuce, the actual patty, etc) and cards with all possible combinations. There's a salt shaker you have to grab and put on top of the correct combination, and you get a point if you do it right, you loose a point if you do it wrong. Personally, I think it's the weakest of the three contestants, both from a mechanics as from a production standpoint: it gets boring pretty fast, there's a lot of combinations so usually people make mistakes, and the salt shaker is actually a wooden doorknob - which is a great idea for a prototype but looks pretty bad on a finished game's box.

# Lunes

(""*Monday*"", 1 player, 10min, [bgg entry](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/259393/lunes))

This is the first local solitary that I know of, but then again I'm no expert. It's a lovely dungeon crawler where you have to collect three reports without getting caught by your boss (handled by AI) and escape the office. You've got some superpowers, like drinking coffee or taking a laxative, to help you fullfil your goals. It comes with a 10 level campaign and you can rearrange the tiles randomly to keep on playing. It's my favorite on this edition of the award for several reasons - the mechanics work, it's fun, the components are well designed and produced, and the theme works great for the game.

# El Camarero

(""The Waiter"", 2-10 players, 30min, [bgg entry](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/273657/el-camarero))

A memory game with a twist, El Camarero puts you on the place of a waiter who has to remember a lot of orders and get them right, lest they get a complaint. In the beggining everybody gets cards corresponding to a meal (complete with entry, beverage, main, side and dessert). These cards include variants (ie. sparkling water vs still water) and you have to choose one side of them. Once you've had time to go through everybody's cards, you turn them to face down and the actual game begins: 8 cards are dealt in the center of the table and players take turns to choose if they wanna say who's got one of those cards (and what specific variation of it!), or discard three of the cards shown. Whenever you notice someone's making a mistake, there's a lovely bell that comes with the game that you can push to interrupt and correct the player. The illustrations are really nice and the overall production level of the game is really good, the game is fun... but while playing it, I felt something was missing, like it was a bit of a lazy design. Don't get me wrong, it works, but in my personal opinion I'm not sure if it's the *best game* that local designers can make :)

# Honorable mentions

* I REALLY LIKED [BALLOTAGE](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/259498/ballotage)!!!! I mean it had issues but it was fun overall, and the theme is so very argentinian. I wish the designer had continued to playtest it and polish some issues before publishing it.
* [Las Divas](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/267356/las-divas) was a fun set collection game for me, although some have pointed out that the theme is barely held there with a pin - it probably could've been about *anything* and work the same.

Here soon I'm about to finish designing and fixing the kinks/mechanics of my game and I have thought about all the various and different approaches in getting my game into the hands of people, and I wanted to get some people's opinions on what would be the best way to approach this when the time comes.

I hope the title didn't confuse anyone. When I say, 'strictly digital', I'm not meaning taking a game and transitioning it into a 3d-environment as an executable; a la Tabletop Simulator. I mean packaging the game contents, boards, pawns, pieces, into workable file documents (.PSD files, .IND files, pdfs, etc.) and charging people for access to these specific items.

I'm thinking of setting this up on Itch.io as that seems like a great place for people to find new and upcoming games that allow you to essentially deliver .zip files to people that are willing to pay, but I'm also making this post to see if there is another medium or platform that may legitimately support this but do it better. I work full-time, and I don't want to see my game squandered by a publisher that will destroy the theme or rebrand my cards, and I don't have the time or logistical skill-set to complete a Kickstarter campaign at the moment.

I suppose my follow up question would be: does this seem viable to do? I was thinking of making the rulebook free, possibly include a list of all cards as an index and have people who want to play make the cards themselves (assuming they would jump this hurdle to start playing), or if people would pay $5-$10 for a structured page they can print-out and use immediately. This includes printing all the tokens, boards, etc.

I have come across some pointers here and there and I haven't really tried them all:

* Drive with a team of 2 cars. The one in pole also takes the last position with 2nd car, etc. Points are given for each place and player wins with combined highest score.
   * I really like this one as it seems to almost completely be balanced. However, it takes way more time to play a game as everyone has to go x2. Furthermore, it can only be achieved for up to 5 players.
* Give players extra WP (Wear Points) based on their starting position.
   * How many points should a player get for each row/place they are behind at the start? Would it make much of a difference?
* Let the player in last position have catch-up mechanism... For example adding extra spaces to their roll depending on their gear. +3 spaces if they are in 3rd gear (if they want it, and should be told upfront before they roll)
   * Not sure if this benefits enough players in the back and works in time for 1 lap.

I recently got City of Kings and have been enjoying it 2 player. However, I hit an issue last night when playing Story 2 Ch 2, which has the goal 'collect 30 wood and bring to the Old Barn'. As these goals are hidden until you finish the previous chapter, I had not put any upgrade points into my workers, and the goal was mathematically impossible to complete in the time left. 

Although I'm not too bothered by surprise quest requirements and will plan accordingly when we replay the chapter, I did have a question about scaling. Having a set # of items to gather is obviously \*much\* easier for higher player counts. Has anyone experimented with having these kind of quests be '# of items per player' (i.e. 10 wood per player)?

Steam page is here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1021190/Scythe_Digital_Edition__Invaders_from_Afar/

Here's hoping Wind Gambit and Rise of Fenris aren't too far behind.

EDIT:Here are the official release notes:

**What’s in this expansion?**

* 2 new factions: Clan Albion and the Togawa Shogunate, with their own starting positions, abilities and units available in two cosmetic variants
* 2 new mats: Innovative and Militant
* 4 new music tracks (2 per new faction) which have been added to the free Soundtrack DLC
* Support for local and multiplayer games with up to 7 players (instead of 5)
* Official rules changes for some Crimean and Polanian abilities in 6-7 players games [see the official expansion rules page 3]
* A new background for the main menu featuring the Togawa Shogunate

**Can I play with the new factions if I don’t own the expansion?**

If you don’t own the expansion you can’t play as Albion and/or Togawa, but you can play against them in online games created by owners of the expansion. This way, the community will not be split between owners and non-owners of the expansion.

**Can I toggle the expansion on and off if I own it?**

Yes: when you create a new game, whether local or online, you can choose to play with or without the expansion.

**What else is new?**

Happy Tuesday, /r/boardgames!

This is a weekly thread to discuss train games and 18xx games, which are a family of economic train games consisting of shared ownership in railroad companies. For more information, [see the description on BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/19/18xx). There’s also a subreddit devoted entirely to 18xx games, /r/18xx, and a subreddit devoted entirely to **[Age of Steam](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4098/age-steam)**, /r/AgeOfSteam.

Here’s a nice guide on [how to get started with 18xx](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/4sygx3/how_to_get_started_with_18xx/?st=iqny4loj&amp;sh=c01b5d88).

Feel free to discuss anything about train games, including recent plays, what you're looking forward to, and any questions you have. 

If you want to arrange to play some 18xx or other train games online, feel free to try to arrange a game with people via /r/playboardgames.

The pirate genre doesn't have quite the same limited appeal as some of the other Fluxx titles, and almost everyone can get on board a game which has players walk the plank, or talk like a pirate! It's certainly a very fun version of the game, and it also adds some interesting twists that aren't part of the original Fluxx. 

The concept of the Fluxx games is simple and easy to grasp: On your turn, you typically draw and play cards, ideally trying to get into play in front of you the two ""Keepers"" that match the current ""Goal"" or win condition. The rules will evolve as the game progresses, and the number of cards that can be drawn or played will vary, along with a host of other rule changes. The dynamic nature of the game and it's unusual feel make it much loved, despite it's very light feel and generous dollops of luck.

**IMPRESSIONS**

**Fluxx-like**: The Pirate Fluxx experience is a whole lot like the original Fluxx, and is unapologetic-ally indebted to it. If you didn't like the game system of the original, chances are you won't like this one either. It's basically the same engine, with a new coat of paint. Many of the cards are the same, which is partly the point, because it's a tried and true game system. 

**Pirate theme**: Despite the Fluxx engine being the same, there's enough things different here that make it feel like a different experience, especially the pirate theme. This comes out with the artwork, the names of the cards, and these thematic changes already gives the game a different feel. 

**Pirate actions**: I especially like some of the unique pirate-flavoured touches, like Plunder, Treasure Map, and cards like Speak Like a Pirate. These add real humour to the game, and as a result it feels like a whole new ""skin"" has been added. They also add welcome abilities and interaction that aren't present in the original Fluxx. Having Keepers which fall into categories like ""ships"" and ""booty"" also gives added meaning to your decisions about which Keepers to play, especially because there are actions that mess with various Keeper types.

**Family friendly**: Like Fluxx, Pirate Fluxx is high on luck - but I never feel that this matters too much. When I'm playing these games, I'm certainly trying my best to win, but I never feel that it's a battle of pure and calculated wits where the smartest player must come out on top. It's about the fun of interaction, and making the best of the cards you get. Regardless of who wins, it's usually a fun experience, which is helped by the fact that games rarely last longer than 15 minutes. This version of Fluxx also works particularly well with just two players, which is another plus.

**RECOMMENDATION**

So is **Pirate Fluxx** for you? If you've never played Fluxx at all, then this is a great entry point, given that it's generally agreed to be one of the best of the Fluxx iterations. And if you already enjoy the regular Fluxx, you'll almost certainly enjoy this one as well. In fact, after playing this form of the game, you may find that the original even seems a little too bland and vanilla! 

Everyone needs a light and fun game to pull out at parties or with family, and Pirate Fluxx is an ideal candidate for this kind of filler. It's easy to learn, quick to play, and the theme and game-play encourages some silliness that helps prevent things becoming too serious. I'm glad to have picked it up! Arrrghh!

First game: Lizard Cult (me), Vagrant, Marquise, Riverfolk and Alliance. 

Vagrant won by a 6-8 VP lead, with the Cult behind them. No-one was hostile towards the Vagrant, and the Riverfolk didn't get many points at all. 

Second game: Eiyre, Vagrant (Me), Riverfolk, Marquise and Alliance. 

Vagrant won again with an almost the same lead, and no-one was hostile to them this game either. We all agreed that if the Vagrant focuses one player to aid for VPs they need to shut them down at some point before they snowball ahead. 

Marquise didn't score at lot either, but they played very passively and only engaged in fights 2-3 times per game at most (same player both times). Reading up on the balance changes now I see that they should be able to play more aggressively and still keep their units with the buff to Field Hospital?

Riverfolk didn't get many points at all in both games, not sure if that was because no-one really traded with them? Even though they had very low prices (1-2) in the first game hardly anyone traded - I bought a few cards as the Cult in order to spawn more Warriors, but that was it. We figured it was because everyone was too busy learning their own faction they couldn't include the beavers in the calculation.

Alliance scored a good few points (I think they were in third both games) by spawning a lot of support tokens, but other than that they didn't really do anything. They controlled one clearing in both games, not sure what we're doing wrong there.

All in all it was a really fun game, but I can totally see the ""criticism"" that the game is the best when everyone is at an equal skill/knowledge level, and that if you have one player who knows the game very well it wouldn't be as fun. Right now I'm excited to try it again with a different faction though.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all liked it a lot, played it twice on saturday. 5 players, took us around 3-4 hours both times - no-one had played it before.&lt;/p&gt;

So I just wanted to do a Shout Out to the Gaming Trunk.  While others have reviewed the organizer itself, I wanted to let everyone know that the Gaming Trunk is stands by their product and I was highly impressed by their resolution of a customer service issue.  

Now the issue I had stems from the fact that the Gaming Trunk has much tighter tolerances for their slots than similar product from the Broken Token.

I had two pieces out of the ones shown that had issues.  One was possibly user error as I'm not very handy - this only being my 3rd organizer with Broken Token's Scythe Legendary and Bloodrage being the others, but the other just had a set of slots that were just a tiny bit too tight for their respective pegs.  

I left a strongly worded but polite review expressing my disappointment that the organizer didn't work out.   And 30 minutes later, I had a respectful reply from the Gaming Trunk, and they offered to make it right in the method which I suggested - which was by replacing the parts that had issues for the cost of shipping.  



Well, as you can see, the Gaming Trunk fulfilled their promise to make it right, and I would highly recommend giving them a shot at organizing your favorite game.

You can use &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template-no-explainer""&gt;this template&lt;/a&gt; to do so. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a version with explanations of what we&amp;#39;re looking for.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you reply to any comment that has a game name in &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt; with &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/r2d8""&gt;/u/r2d8&lt;/a&gt; getparentinfo&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;, one of our robots will tell you more about the game&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember that this is a community full of awesome, helpful people, and feel free to ask your questions whatever they may be. As always, keep it civil and remember what the downvote button is actually for.&lt;/p&gt;

 Looks like it goes until the 20th. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I managed to get two of the sets and they have been fantastic for board games. One also made a great Christmas gift. 

 The original has ""Just"" enough coins in it for a 4 player game of Food Chain Magnate and I can't imagine playing a game of FCM with the paper money. FCM has been one of my favorite games lately and I don't know what I'd have done without these. 

 I was talking about this with my board game group this morning. I almost want to start playing 18XX games just to have a game that needs enough money to use the 500 and 2,000 denominations., they're gorgeous. 

 The wood boxes are obviously way too expensive. I'm thinking of just one box of the new 200 set with a sleeve of the 2K denominations thrown in. I'm quite confused at the ""Build your own bank option"". I get that it's the labor hours needed to uniquely fill those orders but for 30$ you can just buy 3 sleeves of any denomination to add to your order. I can't imagine many people feeling the need to change up more than 3 sleeves worth of denominations.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/roxley/iron-clays-and-spades?ref=discovery_category_newest""&gt;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/roxley/iron-clays-and-spades?ref=discovery_category_newest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

The demonstrators said that a full game could last up to 12 hours (4 ages and with 6 players) but it sounds as if it can be broken up into smaller play times (i.e. 2 ages and fewer players). Kickstarter should launch in September, I think I will definitely keep my eye on this.

I'm happy to try and answer any questions to the best of my ability. Unfortunately, this is the only picture I took but the demo team was taking lots of pictures when we were there so more should turn up soon.

I realise not every game if for everyone and that's all fine but Spirit Island just does not seem that special in any way. After glowing reviews I am a bit dissapointed to be honest.

Most of the games we’d usually pack for a trip or something are a bit of a letdown in terms of both table presence and game weight. 

There’s nothing wrong with our usual 2p fare, and we play them often, but as a couple who enjoys meatier games at our larger meetups, we are getting a huge kick out of **Caper** right now. It’s not got a huge rules overhead (just a lot of iconography that took us about three full games to feel fluent with), but it does cram a surprising amount of tactics in without losing the smooth play sequence and zippy game length of other favorites like **Jaipur** and **Fox in the Forest**.

What impresses me most is how much the mechanics are enhanced by the 1v1 format. Caper’s basic premise is that you’re two criminal masterminds outfitting various thieves with gear in an effort to beat each other to the big scores at various locations. The thieves and gear are drafted, and the final scoring dips into some set collection and a touch of engine building. The real success here is that the drafting really pops. Battling over the locations adds a lot of tension between building up your own board and denying your opponent cards that would benefit them, and the game makes it pretty darn easy to parse what cards your opponent will be interested in. Combined with a good assortment of cards that directly affect your opponent’s board, the game works itself up into a real fever pitch that makes each round’s draft engaging, usually right down to the last pick. 

All of this mechanical strength is accentuated by what is, bar none, one of my absolute favorite productions in my entire collection. The art, colors, and graphic design here are gorgeous and thoughtful.

A nice thing about the enemies was that it's possible to kite them (recommended) and you don't have to aggro them. To me I don't like games where the enemies are always following you. Consumables are also refreshed with enemies so you can get help.

This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter board game projects that are either:

- **newly posted in the past 7 days**, or
- **ending in the next 7 days (starting Jun 03)** and have at least a fighting chance of being funded.

All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, **no need to ask.** (The occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!)

Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between midnight and noon PST.

## Footnotes
- `#hmm` means that something about the project seems a little off. Buyer beware kinda thing.
- `#lolwut` is reserved for projects that seem like copycat games or campaigns put together with little thought. Check 'em out for amusement.
- `#take` tags are for projects that have been restarted for some reason, with the number indicating what iteration we're currently on.
- Did I miss something? Particularly something **new in the last 7 days** or **ending in the next 7 days**? Let me know in the comments and I'll add it in.

## Help Keep This Running
These lists take time and money to put together. Not a lot, but a little. If you enjoy them, maybe [toss me a buck](https://www.paypal.me/Zelbinian/1) now and then. 50% of after-expenses costs will be forwarded along to the [Jack Vasel Memorial Fund](http://www.jackvasel.org/).

[Signing up for a free AirTable account](https://airtable.com/invite/r/wJL1rj8U) via my referral link can help, too. Plus, it's swell!

If you want a shoutout for your donation, put your reddit username in the notes.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this is:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter board game projects that are either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;newly posted in the past 7 days&lt;/strong&gt;, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ending in the next 7 days (starting Jun 03)&lt;/strong&gt; and have at least a fighting chance of being funded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, &lt;strong&gt;no need to ask.&lt;/strong&gt; (The occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between midnight and noon PST.&lt;/p&gt;

2. Q: At turn 5 is an asterisk (\*) - also on 8, 11 and others. What does that mean? A: instead of the brown turns the morale drops, morale drops at those (\*) turns, on higher diffi levels.
3. Q: If I have a worker at black market, and fence, and got medicine from a previous turn, can I buy a gun in 1 turn? Iow, are goods considered to be all present everywhere at the same time? A: yes, items are quantum-mechanically everywhere at the same time.

6. Q: Infiltration phase 2 shows a gun and something else. Am I correct in assuming you have to deliver a gun + a bomb in the same round? A: unanswered.

I'm hoping to do one of these at the start(ish) of each month in 2019.  This post is from 2018.  Last year.   Last year.  LAST YEAR.  It's a historical digest.  It is not from this month.

# Michael’s Links

Okay, let’s begin with a roundup of roundups – we were at the UKGE this month and a whole pile of people wrote summaries of their experiences. Ours is [here](http://meeplelikeus.co.uk/michaels-ukge-2018-diary/) and [here](http://meeplelikeus.co.uk/mrs-meeples-ukge-2018-diary/). Owen Duffy posted [his thoughts over on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8o9pdw/uk_games_expo_2018_heres_what_i_played_how_about/). Matt Thrower started off his[ posts over on There Will Be Games](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8o9pdw/uk_games_expo_2018_heres_what_i_played_how_about/). Bez has a [series beginning here](https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/77651/ukge-2018-sunday-diaryoverall-thoughts-pt-1). Fiona from the Game Shelf has [her roundup too](http://thegameshelf.blogspot.com/2018/06/the-game-shelf-uk-games-expo-day-1.html). There’s another from the [Big Red Barrel](http://www.bigredbarrel.com/blog/2018/06/uk-games-expo-diaries-2018-day-1/). This is one from [Creaking Shelves](http://www.creakingshelves.com/tag/ukge-2018/) and this one is from [Boards and Booze](http://www.boardsandbooze.com/ukge-2018-review-first-timer/). This is just a sampling – there are many more!

[This Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/KevinWilson42/status/1005037145675980800) from Kevin Wilson is well worth reading – it’s on the topic of burnout in creativity and the importance of diversifying your passions.

* * *

This post isn’t a news roundup, but I found[ this discussion around Android: Netrunner coming to the end of its life](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2018/6/8/jacking-out/)to be fascinating. I’ve never actually played it despite having the core set on my shelves – these kind of games are difficult to really approach as a reviewer because they are a hobby within a hobby. Still, it’s always a little melancholy to see a beloved gaming property being buried before its time. Better to burn out than to fade away though?

* * *

Another great Twitter thread this month is from Elizabeth Hargrave, and she [talks about the lack of women in boardgame design](https://twitter.com/elizhargrave/status/1005456326024187905). Food for thought aplenty in here.

* * *

One of the things I was especially pleased with myself about after UKGE was that I only (only!) bought two games despite having the temptation of a whole convention playing on me for a solid three days. That in turn made me reflect upon a blog post I read a few months ago on [‘going deeper, not wider](https://www.raptitude.com/2017/12/go-deeper-not-wider/)’. I still have so many unplayed games, and no real reason to get any more. Perhaps next year I will make it my resolution to simply enjoy what I have rather than forever seek that which I don’t. This isn’t a link about gaming really but it’s a post of relevance to a lot of us I suspect.

* * *

The topic of sexual harassment in the hobby has been something of a hot topic of late – not that it’s any worse just now than it is on a general basis, but just we’re talking about it a bit more. I don’t have any personal information or new insight to share on the topic – anything I say is just going to add more noise. I’ll just point you towards [this post on /r/boardgames](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8t0wpb/are_you_gonna_play_the_victim_all_life_long_my/) for some of the more subtle ways these things can manifest. It’s easy to say ‘don’t sexually harass women’ and nobody with any humanity will disagree. The disagreement is always on a more philosophical basis and simplistic moralistic lessons don’t work there. Worse, the ones that **do** disagree aren’t going to be listening and the rest of us don’t need convincing on that score.

What’s useful though is highlighting non-obvious examples of where sexual harassment comes from. There are many ‘invisible’ ways that it might be happening – ways people may not have even realised – and it’s worth all of us paying extra attention. We posted a related video in a previous roundup too, and [it’s worth revisiting it](http://www.peaceloveandgames.com/casual-sexism-gaming/). If you’re a woman in gaming looking for a like minded community, I hear good things about the [Analog Gamer Grrrls](https://twitter.com/analogamergrrrl/status/1011317069864828928).

* * *

On this theme, Suzanne Sheldon has a very helpful thread on Twitter with regards to helping prevent harassment at convention events – basically, [be mindful and give people an out if they look like they need it](https://twitter.com/425suzanne/status/1006160786895527937). It’s easy to neglect this in the heat of an event but there’s a lot we can do to keep things pleasant for everyone. There was an [equally valuable book-end thread to follow from Origins](https://twitter.com/425suzanne/status/1009121804869197824).

* * *

Jennifer Derrick over on [iSlayTheDragon](http://islaythedragon.com/) has [a great feature on the games that she has kept, the ones that she has purged, and why particular games went one way or another](http://islaythedragon.com/featured/100-reviews-s-51-100-what-i-kept-what-i-purged-and-the-whys-of-both/). It’s something I’ve been thinking of doing with regards to our one-in-one-out policy and I love reading the decisions that went into it here.

* * *

Vox put out a [nice video this month that looks at Dungeons and Dragons](https://twitter.com/twitter/statuses/1008125820353671168), and why it’s more than just a game – it’s a way of connecting with people. That’s true of all the games we play, and I honestly think it’s the most important aspect of this entire hobby. It’s good to see that being emphasised.

* * *

It’s official – Cards Against Humanity has now become suitably cliche to make it fodder for satirical online articles [like this one](https://www.thebeaverton.com/2018/06/report-cards-against-humanity-officially-surpasses-acoustic-guitars-as-the-most-annoying-thing-you-can-bring-to-a-party/). Like the best satire there’s a core of truth here – whenever I see anyone bring out an acoustic guitar case these days I just think to myself ‘I hope there’s an old fashioned tommy gun in there – the alternative is just horrifying’

* * *

[Girls Play Games ](https://www.girlsplaygames.org/)has been running a series of Ladies at the Table – a collection of board game resources created by women. It’s a great set of posts and you can start right now by checking out some [great and (maybe) new content](https://www.girlsplaygames.org/blog/ladies-at-the-table-board-gaming-resources-by-women-gamers-part-1).

* * *

I don’t really see it as my role to moralise over what people like to play – I highlight objectification and sexualisation as accessibility issues but that’s rated on a different axis to my own personal preferences. [This short twitter thread from Elizabeth Hargrave](https://twitter.com/elizhargrave/status/1010870067804991488) on the subject manages to contain a lot of insight in a handful of tweets in the best traditions of the medium.

* * *

There’s another great [Twitter thread from Kevin Wilson](https://twitter.com/KevinWilson42/status/1011002400411406336), this one of the topic of critique, criticism and people simply getting your game wrong and blaming you for it. I hope whenever I’ve given criticism here on Meeple Like Us it has been useful and meaningful but I appreciate it’s still not necessarily easy to take. Kevin has great advice for when your game is trashed by an internet asshole like me.

James Naylor over at [Naylor Games](https://naylorgames.com/) has a[ fascinating post on the topic of game design](https://naylorgames.com/2018/06/21/a-new-model-for-game-design-moving-beyond-the-mechanics-dynamics-aesthetics-framework/) and how the various components come together, interact and reinforce each other to create a game experience. I’ve been mulling it over for a while and unfortunately have yet to come up with anything more insightful than ‘hrm, interesting!’ but I would commend this to your attention.

Thad Johnson sent me a link to an awesome post this month – it’s how to [make Shadows of Camelot accessible to players with low vision](https://equalentry.com/qa-making-physical-board-game-accessible-blind-low-vision-players/). As you might expect, I think it’s well worth your attention. On a similar note, Ertay over at the new blog Sightless Fun has a [great post on how to play Pandemic as a blind person](https://sightless.fun/Pandemic-Board-Games-You-Can-Play-Blind/) and you should check it out and the blog itself.

Tip of the Hat to Rebecca Strang over at [To Play is Human](https://toplayishuman.com/) who shared [this utterly mesmerising video of a mini chess set being made from scratch](https://www.facebook.com/woodworkingdiy1/videos/1882949911755253/). I started off thinking ‘That looks pretty wasteful’ and but gradually fell in love with the technique. Just lovely.

* * *

[One Free Elephant ](https://www.onefreeelephant.co.uk/)have put up a really useful guide on how to [prepare card art for publication](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16KQ5UzvcO6rbg9kVhsghkIOgPiV-PX0HndeJYa8qEH4/edit#heading=h.e5lcytwlccc) – anyone reading this who is considering their own art for game development would do well to give it a look.

Here’s One from the Archives – a book series I’ve been reading my way through over the past few weeks. It’s called [Designers and Dragons](https://www.evilhat.com/home/designers-dragons/) and it is an exhaustive history of the RPG industry from the 70s onwards. While it’s not all gold (I’m currently pushing through a section on dice manufacturing that is soporific) it is overall a fascinating read and well worth your attention.

# This Month’s Spotlight

Have you heard of the [Games Research Network](http://gamesresearchnetwork.org/)? It’s a research group that was founded in Manchester Metropolitan University to explore the intersections between academic and professional practice. They’re not fully focused on tabletop games but I’ve been following [their work](http://gamesresearchnetwork.org/our-research/) for a while and I think it’s definitely worth your attention. For example, you might be interested in how they use [Catan to teach lessons of environmental impact](http://gamesresearchnetwork.org/catan/)or how [empathy and identification emerge in adventure game books](https://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/612211/). For those of us who conflate ‘play’ and ‘work’ there’s a lot to learn in their papers on [what happens when you **treat** play as Work](https://www.academia.edu/31323618/Roger_Caillois_and_e-Sports_On_the_Problems_of_Treating_Play_as_Work). Keep an eye out for what’s going on there – it’s good stuff.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest – there is too much happening in board games. There are too many games, too many podcasts, too many blogs. Just too much of everything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href=""https://meeplelikeus.co.uk/meeple-monthly-roundup-june-2018/""&gt;modified repost&lt;/a&gt; (with mod permission) of an article that was originally posted on Meeple Like Us and it&amp;#39;s aimed at raising the profile of all the great stuff out there you might have missed last year. I&amp;#39;m hoping to do one of these at the start(ish) of each month in 2019.  This post is from 2018.  Last year.   Last year.  LAST YEAR.  It&amp;#39;s a historical digest.  It is not from this month.  It is from last year.  2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s also a &lt;a href=""http://meeplelikeus.co.uk/meeple-monthly-roundup-may-2018/""&gt;round up for the previous month&lt;/a&gt; if you want to catch up with what (was) great in tabletop coverage!  As in, what was great in 2018, which is LAST YEAR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Michael’s Links&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s begin with a roundup of roundups – we were at the UKGE this month and a whole pile of people wrote summaries of their experiences. Ours is &lt;a href=""http://meeplelikeus.co.uk/michaels-ukge-2018-diary/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""http://meeplelikeus.co.uk/mrs-meeples-ukge-2018-diary/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Owen Duffy posted &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8o9pdw/uk_games_expo_2018_heres_what_i_played_how_about/""&gt;his thoughts over on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. Matt Thrower started off his&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8o9pdw/uk_games_expo_2018_heres_what_i_played_how_about/""&gt; posts over on There Will Be Games&lt;/a&gt;. Bez has a &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/77651/ukge-2018-sunday-diaryoverall-thoughts-pt-1""&gt;series beginning here&lt;/a&gt;. Fiona from the Game Shelf has &lt;a href=""http://thegameshelf.blogspot.com/2018/06/the-game-shelf-uk-games-expo-day-1.html""&gt;her roundup too&lt;/a&gt;. There’s another from the &lt;a href=""http://www.bigredbarrel.com/blog/2018/06/uk-games-expo-diaries-2018-day-1/""&gt;Big Red Barrel&lt;/a&gt;. This is one from &lt;a href=""http://www.creakingshelves.com/tag/ukge-2018/""&gt;Creaking Shelves&lt;/a&gt; and this one is from &lt;a href=""http://www.boardsandbooze.com/ukge-2018-review-first-timer/""&gt;Boards and Booze&lt;/a&gt;. This is just a sampling – there are many more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/KevinWilson42/status/1005037145675980800""&gt;This Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; from Kevin Wilson is well worth reading – it’s on the topic of burnout in creativity and the importance of diversifying your passions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post isn’t a news roundup, but I found&lt;a href=""https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2018/6/8/jacking-out/""&gt; this discussion around Android: Netrunner coming to the end of its life&lt;/a&gt;to be fascinating. I’ve never actually played it despite having the core set on my shelves – these kind of games are difficult to really approach as a reviewer because they are a hobby within a hobby. Still, it’s always a little melancholy to see a beloved gaming property being buried before its time. Better to burn out than to fade away though?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great Twitter thread this month is from Elizabeth Hargrave, and she &lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/elizhargrave/status/1005456326024187905""&gt;talks about the lack of women in boardgame design&lt;/a&gt;. Food for thought aplenty in here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I was especially pleased with myself about after UKGE was that I only (only!) bought two games despite having the temptation of a whole convention playing on me for a solid three days. That in turn made me reflect upon a blog post I read a few months ago on &lt;a href=""https://www.raptitude.com/2017/12/go-deeper-not-wider/""&gt;‘going deeper, not wider&lt;/a&gt;’. I still have so many unplayed games, and no real reason to get any more. Perhaps next year I will make it my resolution to simply enjoy what I have rather than forever seek that which I don’t. This isn’t a link about gaming really but it’s a post of relevance to a lot of us I suspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topic of sexual harassment in the hobby has been something of a hot topic of late – not that it’s any worse just now than it is on a general basis, but just we’re talking about it a bit more. I don’t have any personal information or new insight to share on the topic – anything I say is just going to add more noise. I’ll just point you towards &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8t0wpb/are_you_gonna_play_the_victim_all_life_long_my/""&gt;this post on /r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt; for some of the more subtle ways these things can manifest. It’s easy to say ‘don’t sexually harass women’ and nobody with any humanity will disagree. The disagreement is always on a more philosophical basis and simplistic moralistic lessons don’t work there. Worse, the ones that &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; disagree aren’t going to be listening and the rest of us don’t need convincing on that score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s useful though is highlighting non-obvious examples of where sexual harassment comes from. There are many ‘invisible’ ways that it might be happening – ways people may not have even realised – and it’s worth all of us paying extra attention. We posted a related video in a previous roundup too, and &lt;a href=""http://www.peaceloveandgames.com/casual-sexism-gaming/""&gt;it’s worth revisiting it&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a woman in gaming looking for a like minded community, I hear good things about the &lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/analogamergrrrl/status/1011317069864828928""&gt;Analog Gamer Grrrls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this theme, Suzanne Sheldon has a very helpful thread on Twitter with regards to helping prevent harassment at convention events – basically, &lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/425suzanne/status/1006160786895527937""&gt;be mindful and give people an out if they look like they need it&lt;/a&gt;. It’s easy to neglect this in the heat of an event but there’s a lot we can do to keep things pleasant for everyone. There was an &lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/425suzanne/status/1009121804869197824""&gt;equally valuable book-end thread to follow from Origins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Derrick over on &lt;a href=""http://islaythedragon.com/""&gt;iSlayTheDragon&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=""http://islaythedragon.com/featured/100-reviews-s-51-100-what-i-kept-what-i-purged-and-the-whys-of-both/""&gt;a great feature on the games that she has kept, the ones that she has purged, and why particular games went one way or another&lt;/a&gt;. It’s something I’ve been thinking of doing with regards to our one-in-one-out policy and I love reading the decisions that went into it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vox put out a &lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/twitter/statuses/1008125820353671168""&gt;nice video this month that looks at Dungeons and Dragons&lt;/a&gt;, and why it’s more than just a game – it’s a way of connecting with people. That’s true of all the games we play, and I honestly think it’s the most important aspect of this entire hobby. It’s good to see that being emphasised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s official – Cards Against Humanity has now become suitably cliche to make it fodder for satirical online articles &lt;a href=""https://www.thebeaverton.com/2018/06/report-cards-against-humanity-officially-surpasses-acoustic-guitars-as-the-most-annoying-thing-you-can-bring-to-a-party/""&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt;. Like the best satire there’s a core of truth here – whenever I see anyone bring out an acoustic guitar case these days I just think to myself ‘I hope there’s an old fashioned tommy gun in there – the alternative is just horrifying’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.girlsplaygames.org/""&gt;Girls Play Games &lt;/a&gt;has been running a series of Ladies at the Table – a collection of board game resources created by women. It’s a great set of posts and you can start right now by checking out some &lt;a href=""https://www.girlsplaygames.org/blog/ladies-at-the-table-board-gaming-resources-by-women-gamers-part-1""&gt;great and (maybe) new content&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t really see it as my role to moralise over what people like to play – I highlight objectification and sexualisation as accessibility issues but that’s rated on a different axis to my own personal preferences. &lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/elizhargrave/status/1010870067804991488""&gt;This short twitter thread from Elizabeth Hargrave&lt;/a&gt; on the subject manages to contain a lot of insight in a handful of tweets in the best traditions of the medium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s another great &lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/KevinWilson42/status/1011002400411406336""&gt;Twitter thread from Kevin Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, this one of the topic of critique, criticism and people simply getting your game wrong and blaming you for it. I hope whenever I’ve given criticism here on Meeple Like Us it has been useful and meaningful but I appreciate it’s still not necessarily easy to take. Kevin has great advice for when your game is trashed by an internet asshole like me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Naylor over at &lt;a href=""https://naylorgames.com/""&gt;Naylor Games&lt;/a&gt; has a&lt;a href=""https://naylorgames.com/2018/06/21/a-new-model-for-game-design-moving-beyond-the-mechanics-dynamics-aesthetics-framework/""&gt; fascinating post on the topic of game design&lt;/a&gt; and how the various components come together, interact and reinforce each other to create a game experience. I’ve been mulling it over for a while and unfortunately have yet to come up with anything more insightful than ‘hrm, interesting!’ but I would commend this to your attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thad Johnson sent me a link to an awesome post this month – it’s how to &lt;a href=""https://equalentry.com/qa-making-physical-board-game-accessible-blind-low-vision-players/""&gt;make Shadows of Camelot accessible to players with low vision&lt;/a&gt;. As you might expect, I think it’s well worth your attention. On a similar note, Ertay over at the new blog Sightless Fun has a &lt;a href=""https://sightless.fun/Pandemic-Board-Games-You-Can-Play-Blind/""&gt;great post on how to play Pandemic as a blind person&lt;/a&gt; and you should check it out and the blog itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tip of the Hat to Rebecca Strang over at &lt;a href=""https://toplayishuman.com/""&gt;To Play is Human&lt;/a&gt; who shared &lt;a href=""https://www.facebook.com/woodworkingdiy1/videos/1882949911755253/""&gt;this utterly mesmerising video of a mini chess set being made from scratch&lt;/a&gt;. I started off thinking ‘That looks pretty wasteful’ and but gradually fell in love with the technique. Just lovely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.onefreeelephant.co.uk/""&gt;One Free Elephant &lt;/a&gt;have put up a really useful guide on how to &lt;a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/16KQ5UzvcO6rbg9kVhsghkIOgPiV-PX0HndeJYa8qEH4/edit#heading=h.e5lcytwlccc""&gt;prepare card art for publication&lt;/a&gt; – anyone reading this who is considering their own art for game development would do well to give it a look.&lt;/p&gt;

Hi everyone! I’ve been building my collection since the 2009-10 timeframe. This picture is about 1/4 of my collection. I just reorganized and was really happy with this result. I don’t think I would change anything about my collection. I’ve been really good about editing over the past few years. Before every convention I set a goal to sell/trade/donate as many games (or more) as I plan to buy. The only thing I’m always trying to improve on is getting unplayed games to the table. 

I live in Japan right now, so for the past two years I’ve been working to add a lot of Japanese and Taiwanese games to my collection. This pic has some of my favorites from the past three Tokyo Game Markets. 

I would say my favorite game right now is Mini WWII; my favorite newly acquired game is Improvement of POLIS; my favorite heavy game is TI4 (my friends and I have a monthly 6-player game); and my favorite game of all time is Sentinels of the Multiverse.

This stems from the fact that most publishers seem to base this number on the average playtimes of their playtesters. These people have oftentimes played the games dozens, sometimes hundreds of times.

Now here's the big problem. Imagine people new to the hobby. They enter a board game store and pick something that catches their interest, taking the estimated play time into consideration. They may think to themselves ""2 hours? That seems reasonable!"", and they take e.g. Eldritch Horror with them, a game that can take three or four hours in the first game even with two players.

You may argue that the estimated playtime is a very subjective number, and you are absolutely right with that. But taking the lowest possible estimation is a lie. This damages the level of trust that many of those new customers will give publishers in the future, and in turn is harmful to the growth of the market.

But this is not only a problem with people new to the hobby. I play for a long time now, and I never know if the estimated time is for new gamers or veterans. It's deeply confusing, and the only help is in looking the game up on BGG. Those playtimes seem much more in line with my experiences, which tells me that this is not a subjective criticism.

I did the typical rush and buy anything that caught my eye or looked like fun with groups of people. Suppose i figured out quite quickly which types of games i enjoy and dislike. I wouldn't say i hate Co Ops or Ameritrash games... just prefer Euro's and mechanics :) My favourite games are CoB, GAH, Viticulture, 51st State MS, Broom Service, Kingdomino, The Quest For El Dorado and Summoner Wars. But i rate each of my games high and would love to play each and every one more often.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a hard limit of 40 games, but it started to feel overwhelming to me when i reached 35 games. So recently i culled about 13 games. Out of those games i regret getting rid of Agricola and Spirit Island. Maybe i will pick them up again some time around. I have 5 games on my backlog right now. Troyes, Keyflower, Nusfjord, A Feast For Odin and Notre Dame. Really looking forward to getting them all to the table some time around. My backlog was 9 games a month ago, so I'm making some progress.

&amp;#x200B;

For now im working on 1 in 1 out, but i would really like to add Carpe Diem and Orleans to my collection. Concordia might  get sent to a new home after a couple more plays. So it will free up a spot. Other than that im happy to not feel any sort of anxiety over games that may not get played.

I wouldn&amp;#39;t say i hate Co Ops or Ameritrash games... just prefer Euro&amp;#39;s and mechanics :) My favourite games are CoB, GAH, Viticulture, 51st State MS, Broom Service, Kingdomino, The Quest For El Dorado and Summoner Wars. But i rate each of my games high and would love to play each and every one more often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a hard limit of 40 games, but it started to feel overwhelming to me when i reached 35 games. So recently i culled about 13 games. Out of those games i regret getting rid of Agricola and Spirit Island. Maybe i will pick them up again some time around. I have 5 games on my backlog right now. Troyes, Keyflower, Nusfjord, A Feast For Odin and Notre Dame. Really looking forward to getting them all to the table some time around. My backlog was 9 games a month ago, so I&amp;#39;m making some progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now im working on 1 in 1 out, but i would really like to add Carpe Diem and Orleans to my collection. Concordia might  get sent to a new home after a couple more plays. So it will free up a spot. Other than that im happy to not feel any sort of anxiety over games that may not get played.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

2 days with no wife and no life obligation .  


just me and the guys hanging around teaching them some of the light games i personally selected from my collection to carter their need and trying not to prolong it because after all most of them are relatively new/hate very long ones.  


anyway the 1st day i only played korra,KF and 7th continent with only one friend because i know this is the only guy who actually like any type of BG (whether it's long or short as long its good and fun) so we played the 1st two like chess for like 2 hours and then we switched to 7th continent and boy it was a blast ,i think we may made couple of mistakes here and there but we really enjoyed it so much that we played it in the next day as soon as we woke up and trying to play as much as we can before the rest of the group comes aka ""normies"" .  


we stopped playing when they came so i put multiple light games like the high society ,modern art,love letter and sagrada(with expansion).  


they all loved it because the group were consistent of 4-5 players and each game truly shine in that number and doesn't stay it's welcome for too long.

I was in a very decisive last place, stuck in a corner with no monuments, no temples, and no way to really generate Bricks (despite replacing my full hand 3-4 times), but it was honestly fun just to watch the conflicts happen across the sprawling civilization in the middle of the board.

Then the player in the lead said that something seemed off. We checked the rules, and found out we had been doing monuments wrong.

&gt;	Our Interpretation: At the end of each turn, monuments generate points for each of the respective leaders.

&gt;	Actual Rule: At the end of each turn, the **active player** checks for monument control, and gains a point for each monument their leaders control.

In other words, a player with 3 monument colors controlled generated 6 points between each turn, allowing them to ignore those categories completely and focus on their lowest. This strategy made monuments game-defining, rather than just nice-to-have. It also seemed like monuments would be way worse in 2p, because fewer turns.

Despite this mistake (which hit me the hardest, as I focused on placing tiles), the game was fun. Treasure design is really clever, conflicts are exciting, and the majority of the rules were intuitive. I’m excited to play with the correct monument rules, and some of the advanced variants as well.

It’s a really well designed game which convinced me to look into more of Knizia’s designs. Between this, Spirit Island, Scythe, and Jaipur, this sub is 4-0 on good game suggestions.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this sub heavily praised T&amp;amp;E, I picked up the game (used for $20) about a year ago, but could never drum up interest.

I have a Discord server with a few people from different timezones (mostly North America and Asia) and I'm looking for more players who are interested in playing Codenames online.

if you're interested, PM me for an invite link to the Discord server! we play casually and semi-regularly (: if you're new to the game, it goes like this: there are two teams, each with a clue-giver (spymaster) and one or more guessers. On the table (screen) are 25 random words. Each spymaster is trying to give their team one-word clues that help them relate one or more of the words on the table together (without saying the actual words, of course) so that the guessers can figure out which of the random words are affiliated with their team (only the spymasters know this information). The spymaster hopes their team will pick the words that they intended based on their clue without picking cards affiliated with the enemy team, neutral words, or the ""spy"" word, which immediately ends the game. Whichever team can identify all their words first wins.

As an example, a clue of ""animal"" might be great if you're trying to get your team to guess ""cat"" and ""dog"", but horrible if the opposing team also controls the ""lion"" card. On the other hand, maybe the word ""pet"" gives just enough information about a cat and a dog without also implicating lion. Should you risk it?

Despite the fact that this game appears ""meh"" based on the concept, it's a lot of fun to play. Spymasters will agonize over what clue can safely implicate their own cards on the table without overlapping (and therefore helping) those of the opposing team. Teams will struggle to come up with the logic that the spymaster must have used, some wrong guesses will be made, hilarity (and frustration) will likely ensue.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi!

Those friends then moved into Magic: The Gathering, which I used to play ~20-25 years ago, and they were trying to persuade me too, but I can't go back to that game now.  I like silo'd games, and there's just too much to Magic.    
  


Subconsciously I felt a bit of an itch from then though, and am a longtime videogamer who reads some sites who occasionally also report on boardgames as well, and I feel like maybe it just reached critical mass where I started looking into it more myself (mostly thru here in reddit actually).   
  


All of that, coupled with finally reducing my videogaming pile of shame to near-nil (for the time being), and feeling like I was staring at a screen of some sort for 90% of my waking hours, meant boardgaming started to really appeal.

* bottom row: three-and-up games  
  



Still not sure how to best arrange them.  Kind of want to lay them down, but also like them standing up.  Need a solution that allows both at once :P.     
  


Also still on its way in the mail is the re-release of Camel Up, and have the all-in Root through Kickstarter coming (Root was one of the first titles that really sparked my interest, but was concerned it would never get to the table.  Am spending the next six months working some friends up to games like that :P), and also backed Bites on Kickstarter recently.  
  


Games I'd still really like to pick up: Great Western Trail (keep changing my mind on this, which means it WILL happen one day) Inis, Raiders of the North Sea expansions (have the solo mode), possibly Concordia.  
  


Games I'm just not interested in that seem to be popular: Terraforming Mars (did just get this on the Humble Bundle sale so will see if I like it or not), A Feast For Odin (seems cool but way too expensive for me), Agricola (farming theme is not something I'm into), Food Chain Magnate (tho have been watching some Heavy Cardboard playthroughs of this and it's growing on me - but again like AFfO, it's simply too expensive).   

  

Most desired game to get to the table next; The Estates.  Will probably have some friends over in a couple weeks, start off with a game or two of Azul, then move on to The Estates.  

  

Have played Santorini the most; probably fifteen or so times with the same friend, and we haven't even introduced the Gods yet.  Really enjoy Raptor too.  I tend to like games that have a definitive win condition as opposed to games that are determined by triggering the end and then calculating the winner.  
  

One side effect of going to much too fast is buying games that I then want a more complex version of.  Case in point My Little Scythe, which I bought as a pre-cursor to Scythe, thinking I'd get into MLS and then get Scythe like a year down the line, except now I have the main event AND Rise of Fenris and still haven't even played My Little Scythe...!  Sigh :P.  
  

I have been consuming board game media like crazy though; every reddit conversation leads me to googling 5+ games and then multiple reviews for each, etc etc.  Have watched so many videos; how to plays, SU&amp;SD reviews, Heavy Cardboard four-hour playthroughs, etc etc.  And then there's the photography side - there's some super talented people on Instagram taking very lovely board game photos!  
  

Tl;dr, videogame pile of shame has been replaced by a boardgame pile of shame, which is altogether more spatially-demanding, but it's OK because I really enjoy spending more time away from screens and in the company of others.

&amp;#x200B;

I started playing **Magic: The Gathering** and **HeroQuest** in 1995, when I was in fifth grade. I still consider myself an MtG enthusiast, but in the last few years other board games have almost completely replaced any time I would have spent on Magic. This was a slow conversion that began about 10 years ago when I first started purchasing **Dominion** expansions. I had a few other games at that time as well, but at some point I decided to go out on a limb and buy **Agricola.** That was the first full realization for me of what modern board games were capable of, and the tipping point that eventually led to the [collection you see here](https://imgur.com/gallery/P1oipJi).

&amp;#x200B;

*What would you change about your collection if you could?*

&amp;#x200B;

My [actual complete collection of games](https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/Diakonov) goes somewhat beyond what's on the shelf in the picture. I run the tabletop game club at the high school I teach at, for which I have another whole shelf of games. It's a mix of titles I've picked up expressly for the club and a functional graveyard for games which I've decided I don't need to have at home. I have too many games and need to begin an actual culling process in the near future.

&amp;#x200B;

*What is your favorite game that you own?*

&amp;#x200B;

For the past couple of years, probably **The Great Zimbabwe** or **Keyflower**.

&amp;#x200B;

*What are your newest games?*

&amp;#x200B;

The newest three games on the shelf are **Die Macher**, **1830**, and **Evolution: Climate**. Haven't played any of them yet!

&amp;#x200B;

My current major fascination is with **1846**. It's my introduction to 18xx games, and I'm only three games deep so far, but it feels like it might begin to warp my collection.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How long have you been involved in the hobby?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

No one cared about this, we made the change and continued playing. Yes, it probably made it harder for the murderer, but whatever. 

The second rule was the reversal. It's near the variant section so I'm not even sure it's completely necessary, but the rule is that the murderer and accomplice in a 6+ player game, of caught, get one guess at the witness, and if they get it right they win. 

Personally, I think this is a terrible rule that should only be used in 10+ player games. It gives the murderer a blind 25% chance to win the game, regardless of strategy. And in all honesty, it will be higher than that if they have some deductive ability. In my games, the murderer generally won 33% of the time. Reversal feels like a dumb way to win. 

With that being said, for people who have played with it, does it add anything to the game? Does it improve the game in any way? Our solution to combat the witness was to house rule that someone can only claim to be the witness during the presentation phase.

I'm absolutely loving **Railroad Ink** but I've noticed the included felt erasers don't always clean up my board like I want them to. I've put together a handy little guide on how to clean your board more thoroughly. Hope it helps!

* **Step 1:** Get a small bowl and fill it partway with warm water. You can add a small drop of dish soap if you like but it isn't necessary.

* **Step 2:** Get a clean cloth and dip a small portion of it in the water. You don't want water dripping from the cloth so, if you get it too wet, either ring out the excess or dab it on a dry portion of the cloth until it's just damp.

* **Step 3:** Gently apply the cloth to the face of the game board in wipe in a single motion to one side. Before you begin, notice that if you had only placed one of your T-shaped railroad squares 90 degrees clockwise in turn 3, it would have set you up to connect 2 more exits to your largest network, as well as avoid an error, which would have allowed you to beat your best ever score by 8 points.

* **Step 4:** Laugh out loud while silently screaming inside your head. Berate yourself for being impatient and not having the foresight think of that possible outcome before putting marker to board. Stare at the board for 4 hours trying to find all the other possibilities you may have missed.

* **Step 5:** Become withdrawn. When your partner asks ""What's wrong?"" just look down at the floor and shake your head, muttering under your breath about rivers and lakes. Start taking your meals into the study and eating with the door closed, constantly rolling dice and recording the outcome, hoping to find the secret pattern you're sure exists and that will lead to a perfect game. Sink into a deep depression.

* **Step 6:** Get divorced. Move out. Live in a bachelor apartment, surrounded by empty takeout boxes and 100's of sheets of graph paper pinned to every available bit of wall space, each square holding a road or a rail... or both. You know the answer is somewhere within one of these squares but which one? Keep searching, always searching, never stop searching...

* **Step 7 (Optional):** In order to speed up the drying process, use a dry cloth or paper towel to remove any excess moisture from the board.

I like to invite my collleagues for board games evenings but I don't know how I can ask nicely that the number of players is limited to 4-6.

Most of my games are for 4 people, some go to 6. Furthermore, I don't like big groups. It slows down games a lot. In my opinion, 4 or 5 players are ideal for a board games evening. Whenever I invite my colleagues, I say that places are limited to 6. But then suddenly everyone wants to join, and then people that barely play board games say that we can play other games (so the games I own and planned to play are suddenly declined by the group). I really hate this. I can never play the games I bought or want to play. We end up with playing stupid party games for 8 people.

How do you deal with this? I cannot just personal invites to 3 people because that would be mean. But I also don't like how I always end up with a big group and play less fun party games. 

Anyone got similar experiences or tips? I have searched on this sub and most people suggest splitting the group in 2 but even that is not possible because they want to play together. I feel like I am the organizer and owner of the games but can never play the games I want

I'm looking for the name of a game I both owned and played at school as part of the geography curriculum. 

It was a giant foam world map- maybe 10 x 10- labeled with countries and cities, etc. Players were seated and crawled and leaned on the board to play. 

Each player had push pins and thread in a given colour, and drew cards. They then had to make their way around the world putting pins in the board and running the tread around them ultimately reaching all the locations on their cards. 

By the end the board was a web of string in all directions- and the cleanup took forever.  It is still one of my all-time favorites. 

For the life of me I can't remember the name of the game- never mind find a way to obtain one. 

Any help would be much appreciated. 

Thanks.

Starting at the 31m mark there's a neat segment where Kellen talks a bit about the need to reconcile his deepening engagement with the hobby versus his desire to keep it and his professional life relatively separate. 

It struck a particular chord with me because as a deep introvert I've always gravitated towards things like CCG's (Magic during Ice Age, Legend of the Five Rings during Imperial) and niche video games (gold box D&amp;D, SNES Ogre Battle, Icewind Dale).  Growing up my close friends mostly shared the same interests but after moving away it was an aspect of myself I tried to hide at my new high school. 

Then in my older age board games became a natural fit but even today it's not something I'd bring up with just anyone, especially at work. So it was cool hearing the contrast in experiences between someone like Becca Scott (actress and media personality) and someone like Kellen Laker (advertising) with experiences similar to mine. I know for me personally, as a long time listener of **Boardgame Barrage** I was quite surprised to hear the full story of why 'Kalen' became 'Kellen'.

I've been slowly coming around these days with friends and family but there have been expected fits and starts (Sorry Ernie and Terrance, I should have started you guys with something lighter than **Viticulture w/Tuscany**!).  Good news is I can definitely agree with Kellen that **Illusion** has been an amazing hit with non-gamers, especially with my mom who requested a copy for herself!

So, fellow redditors...what were some of your experiences when publicly engaging with our hobby? Has your school or profession been inviting or did you get weird looks?  Is it still something where you tend to be choosy on who you'll mention the hobby to? Or have you always been open with your enjoyment, who cares who knows?

Sidenote:

The whole podcast is great spirited fun, with discussions about **Cosmic Encounter**, **Innovation** and Kellen's style of collection management, among other things. I was introduced to the Victory Point podcast via Boardgame Barrage's awesome Discord channel and I'll definitely be checking them out in the future. 

And I'd also like to give a shout out to [Boardgame Barrage](https://boardgamebarrage.com/), one of my favorite podcasts.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never played Diplomacy, seen Diplomacy or known anyone, personally, who has played Diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

My friends and I have been developing a board game for a few months now.

After additional iterations and play testing based on player feedback, we feel like the gameplay is solid.

We came up with the theme, named all the cards, made sure the wording of everything makes sense, and I'm currently making the art on each of the cards. We're gonna hammer out a rule book soon, and after the cards, I'm going to design the box art.

Everyone starts of with a communities on the board as the planet slowly dies. Players have to trade, build, and innovate in an effort to either be the last community standing or by pooling enough resources to get off world.

Each round everybody gets cards based on the land. Players then have to decided on what they give to the common good, while simultaneously keeping their own communities alive. 

The game board would start fertile and provide resources, but at the end of each round a piece would be flipped to show the dying landscape. Resources would dwindle, workers would starve and die off, and alliances would crumble as players make decisions in the interest of self preservation.

&amp;#x200B;

There would need to be some way to balance the need/desire to horde for yourself vs work towards the common goal, but I think the base concept itself could work.

Using the base Catan board with a set up of cities etc would be the base. But I'm not sure of how to deal the resources in a fair manner to start with.

I've moved to Belgium a couple of months ago and whilst my SO likes to play occasionally, I miss playing boardgames more often. The games are just sitting there begging to be played! I would really like to get to meet some folks around Brussels that are into playing mostly medium-to-heavyweight euro games. Though I'm open to other games as well.

The games I currently have with me are: 

* Orleans (+ Trade &amp; Intrigue expansion)
* Fields of Arle
* Warchest
* Quacks of Quedlinburg (+ expansion)
* Architects of the West Kingdom

I think that Outpost Gamecentral is Brussels is a good place to meet up from what I've seen. There are a lot of boardgames that can be borrowed to play in house as well, so I'd be open to playing other games like Scythe, Viticulture, and whatever else.

I hope this isn't against the rules of the sub.

I'm in the process of designing some custom storage for my copy of **Gloomhaven**, and I have a few questions to help me in the process. Please keep in mind I haven't yet played the game, so some of these questions might seem simplistic or naive, but I'm going to be working on this custom storage at the same time as beginning my campaign.

&amp;#x200B;

***For Character Classes:***

1. What things need to be stored alongside the character board between games? I understand that everything in the current character boxes goes in there: Class board, character sheet, class tokens, miniature, combat modifier deck, and action card deck. What else?
2. Would it be beneficial to be able to store actual money in a class box rather than simply notating it on the character sheet?
3. How many item cards, on average (or at most) would be stored with a character during a campaign?

&amp;#x200B;

***For Monster Storage:***

1. I know monster ~~combat modifier~~ ability decks are different for different monster types. My current idea is to create a storage solution by monster type - a box which would store the standees for all different monsters of a type in the same box as the ~~modifier~~ ability deck that applies to all of them. Does that seem reasonable?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to be doing some research while this thread is active - looking at some of the custom storage solutions that have already been created by folks like The Broken Token, but answers to these questions from experienced players would still help quite a bit.

My family has never been great. They love deeply but are terribly flawed. Family has never been a ""good"" thing in my life.

I've had friends who embrace me as close to family as possible but I still never felt truly like family. I treated them as best as I knew to in terms of family. If you've ever not had a good family, I'm sure you'll know what I mean by this.

When I married my wife, I was afraid I would forever feel this way. My in-laws are good people. Everyone has flaws but they are truly good. Despite this, I felt on the outside for a few years. Until this past weekend.

**Game Nights**

We all went on vacation together. It was my grandmother-in-law's birthday. We went to celebrate with her. Then we spent some days all together after.

Everyone in the family knows board games are my hobby. They always ask me to bring a few when we get together. Each night we played games. **Tortoise &amp; the Hare**, **For Sale**, **NMBR 9**, **Dream Home**, &amp; **Revolution**. 

It was a great joy to see family spending time together, gaming, laughing, telling stories. Now, I do love heavier games. I love burning my brain for hours. I love deeply tactical/strategic games. But I also love the light games that create these moments.

While we were playing, one of my wife's sisters, G, told us how she loved her year of mission work and is returning to the same organization. G might not be around for Christmas or holidays. 

G loves games the most out of her family. She always wants to try the games I bring. She always gets into them. She is a gamer, no doubt. If she lived closer, I would be inviting her to game nights. 

With all of this in mind, I gifted her a game, **Harbour**. I know it's not the best game but it is easy enough to learn, has a small foot print, and is in a small/compact box. It is perfect for her being able to carry/travel while on her mission. 

I know this was a long story to say I gifted a game to my sister-in-law. I can't think of any other hobby that would create the same circumstances. I'm proud to be a part of a community that creates these moments to share.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preamble&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Buying used is cheaper, you can do that through the monthly bazaar, eBay or BGG's Marketplace.

My question is what is the proper price? After scrounging around, it seems that the standard price of a new hobby item is 60%, so that's what I make my offers for and expect.

I tried to buy a board game that's BNIS (Brand New in Shrink) and offer 60% 'cause I don't care about it's condition. I am buying used. If I wanted to buy brand new, I'd go to the store or maybe wait for a sale. It's not like the fun runs out after a certain point.

In another offer, someone wanted to trade. Figuring out the price is also useful. I look at the BGG listings and I see the game goes for roughly $20 USD. Sweet, I have an idea of how much the game is worth. Then I look at the game I have, which I pretty much loathe, so I am astounded to find out that's it's valued at over $120 USD.

Like... Why make that offer? Hope I'm dumb? Or is it just a crapshoot of lack of codified practices?

**Description from Boardgamegeek**:

In Imhotep, the players become builders in Egypt who want to emulate the first and best-known architect there, namely Imhotep.

Over six rounds, they move wooden stones by boat to create five seminal monuments, and on a turn, a player chooses one of four actions: Procure new stones, load stones on a boat, bring a boat to a monument, or play an action card. While this sounds easy, naturally the other players constantly thwart your building plans by carrying out plans of their own. Only those with the best timing — and the stones to back up their plans — will prove to be Egypt's best builder.

Decided to try both the original map and Elysium at the same time.  I’ve heard of BGG users coming up with their own variations so I decided to give it a shot. 

Set up: 
- I used one corporation card and two prelude cards.  
- 4 colony tiles

Requirements:
-  9 ocean tiles split between boards 
- raise both temperature meters to +8°
- raise both oxygen meters to 14%
- I only used one income 
- I started at generation 20 

I decided to start at generation 20 as I wasn’t sure how it would all play out.  Turns out I was able to finish in 14 generations as the last few rounds really generated lots of resources.   

Whenever I came across a card that had requirements I would use it as long as one of the boards met the requirements.  

Overall I enjoyed playing this way.  It allowed me to really enjoy the engine for a bit longer.  The only thing that bothers me is the theme.  Thematically, it doesn’t make much sense to have to make both boards meet the requirements.  I mean if one side of Mars had 14% wouldn’t the other side be as well?  The temperature sort of makes sense to me.  I wanted to do double the ocean tiles but I need to order some more tiles for that I guess.  

I will probably try this again and switch some things up.  Any tips or questions are appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/gallery/sVHTOV6""&gt;here’s the initial setup and final round&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Boardgames are obscenely expensive in kuwait.
One way we boardgamers can save is by selling or even better trading games to each other.

Most people in Kuwait don't use the bgg trading functions. By creating a group we can encourage their use and also trade directly in the app.

I went to my first board game convention in 2016. Red November and Betrayal at the House on the Hill were the first hobby board games I played and I still own and play both. My collection tends more towards co-op and I don't do a lot of direct player conflict. I have lots of family games and play games with my 8 year old often. 

Not pictured are the other shelf of RPG books, my daughter's games, and Mythic Arcana which hasn't made it on the shelf yet. 

Don't ask about the pile of shame.

The things I would change about my collection are more worker placement games and fewer ""this looked neat on Kickstarter"" games. I would also have time to play them more!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;4 years of board gaming &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/gallery/OR7dENV""&gt;https://imgur.com/gallery/OR7dENV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We all know how expensive this hobby is. People either i) get carried away and buy too many games or ii) have an agonizing time choosing from among the hundreds of games. Right now I fall under ii)... Lucky for my wallet. 

Instead of buying/selling/trading, I suggest a 4th option: temporarily trading games. The rules are:

1. List out the games you have

2. List out the games you are interested in (or requirements like number of players/duration/complexity) 

3. Trade a few games at a time (similar total value) 

4. Set a duration. E.g 3 weeks

5. Try out the games and reverse the trade after the time is up

Of course, there is an element of trust here that both parties are committing to return the games on time, and that the games will be well taken care of.  Maybe a deposit of some sort to a third party can help... I don't know.

Benefits
1. This can save us a lot of money in the long run as we can try before we buy the games we really want to keep.  

2. Trading a few games at a time increases productivity (rather than meeting twice to trade a single game). 

3. Knowing that you'll get your games back in a few weeks can reduce your ""analysis paralysis"" of what game to buy/trade. 

4. You can try out games anytime in the comfort of your home, and with people you are  comfortable with (instead of travelling to a board game cafe, or joining a meetup group with strangers) 

What do you guys think? I haven't tried this yet but am pretty keen to try out with my local Meetup group (I haven't actually joined any meetups though).","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just had a Eureka moment.
