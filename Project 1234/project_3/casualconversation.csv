This is not a post about that sub population but rather the young community that has been built around vaping simply due to it's ""cool factor"" that many swear by.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to start off this post by telling you that I have never touched an electronic cigarette or any inhaled drugs for that matter; however, this is still a post about my personal experience with the devices and the culture surrounding. As someone in the upcoming generation in their youth, it's very alarming to see 90% of my close friends from Middle School (6-8) turn to daily and/or weekly use of e-cigs with no prior use of standard tobacco products. I'm not going after a single company such as Juul (that's where all the ""buzz"" seems to be for some reason, though they are a large part of the market they aren't solely responsible for all the underage use - I say this even though a good percentage of the people (90%+) I have seen who turn to vaping even though they haven't been users of cigarettes do indeed use Juul) simply because there's more to the problem than just a single company. Anyway, it's alarming because a good percentage of my high school population has become dependent on nicotine intake and other chemicals. It's becoming a serious problem due to the fact people can't function without it.

&amp;#x200B;

You may argue there are zero nicotine options. This is another issue altogether. There is one instance in which zero nicotine would still be vaped in my eyes: socially to look ... cool? I personally don't see the point of e-cigarette use at this point whatsoever **(there are no exceptions here)** because all you're doing is harming yourself and not fulfilling any withdrawal  your brain has developed. If you're doing this, STOP. This is in no way, shape, or form good for you. The inhalation of these chemicals (though they may be food-grade, some may argue - I argue: if it's not air it's not good for you) purposefully and regularly harm you. Just as excessive intake of water can kill you, same goes here.

&amp;#x200B;

A quick note before I transition to my last point: I don't see high school e-cig users as vapers. You are a smoker when it comes down to it, and that doesn't look good on you.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I have established the obvious issues with the devices as a whole (no matter the content), I want to go on as to why **companies, shops, and the culture are doing more harm to the non-smokers than to the one's who use their products**. What I am about to say is why the title of this post is the title. For the past 2-3 years I have seen the nicest, purest people, begin using Juul and other vape products like there's no tomorrow. Completely normal youth have turned into constant users who need a hit. Everyday, I have to watch the people I care about become incapable to care about themselves for just a second think about what they're doing to themselves. Their lives in my eyes aren't a toy to play around with, because as far as I am concerned - you only get one to be who you are right now. I get it, people will suck - but this is here to express my truth. For how much we focus on ourselves nowadays (mental health, etc.) I can't believe people around me still vape without a second thought.

&amp;#x200B;

I was walking home yesterday from my tram stop after making breakfast for a sick friend of mine who is sick. In front of me was this young man who had been on the tram with me, I had noticed him because he has this beautiful Arabic calligraphy shirt, long hair, and just looked like the type of person I would be liable to hang out with, just kind of noticing a stranger. 

I didn’t notice the way he walked getting on the tram or anything and the ride was uneventful. When we got off the tram, he wound up being at the same stop. 

He was walking in front of me, and I noticed he had a pretty bad limp but didn’t think anything of it. He turned left at the intersection where I go right to my apartment. At this intersection is a convenience store and there were five big guys standing outside, all pretty kind of ripped, they looked like they were big gym guys into lifting and that type of thing. Pretty young, maybe eighteen to twenty at the oldest. 

I saw their attention go to this young man, and a weird manically gleeful expression light up their faces, and they started literally pointing, laughing, and then making really exaggerated, hammy pantomimes of his limp and laughing at him. 

Disability discrimination is bullshit. I have MS, am twenty seven, and have faced a lot of this myself. I am also ex military. I’m also about 145 lbs, blind in one eye, and partially paralyzed. 

I went up to this group of guys and cursed them out so thoroughly it would make a sailor blush. I came over storming, “What the fuck is wrong with you, you fucking cock sucking assholes? You’re being absolute cunts, you pansy ass motherfuckers. Only little bitches would stand around with four syncophantic shitwipes making fun of disabled people. They just balked and watched me 

Oh yeah, I am an American and I live in Poland. This interaction would be highly unusual here, and also many people speak English and these guys were the right age to, but in my neighborhood it’s mainly native working class folk. Anyways from one of them I hear a meek, “ nie rozumiem,” (I don’t understand) so to make sure that the whole message was understood, I made hand gestures with my right index finger penetrating a hole I made with my left index and thumb (you know the gesture) with a look of disgust on my face, then flipped off all of them with both barrels, turned around, and stormed off. Hilariously they all just looked really shocked and three of them looked pretty ashamed but none of them said anything further and I walked away without further confrontation. 

Hot damn was I pissed. I went home and really just wanted to turn around and fight these bigots, not that that is rational at all, just saying how I felt. 

Anyway, if you ever see someone doing stuff like this to someone, even if you don’t know them, if you are in public and can safely do so, call them out. Look out for each other.

This week has mostly been just hanging around, waiting for school to end, not really having any classes or normal school work. Yesterday we had a sort of course with an organization that's all about minimizing stress and maximizing confidence in youth, basically all about mental health, peer pressure, bullying and such.

This specific day they were focusing on individually having confidence and not bullying yourself (we are our own worst enemies). We were supposed to go around saying one positive thing we could think of about ourselves.

For some context, I have struggled with anxiety for the past 6 years and this last year has been incredible for me as I've improved so much. However, time pressure, expectations and speaking in groups is still hard.

I immediately got anxious, and started doing my best to think of something. Thankfully, I was the last in the group, so I had more time. All I could think of was my anxiety, and how proud I am of what I've done this year. But that wouldn't work because 1. I would have to explain the situation which would be too many words to say (thanks, anxiety) and 2. the atmosphere in the group was very light so I didn't want to bring it down by talking about something so serious.

My turn came, and I hadn't thought of anything so I just told them I didn't have anything. The group leader said ""Okay, no pressure, but can anyone else think of something positive about Eryn?"" 

Immediately three people in the group raised their hands. One of them is my best friend, and two are people I don't know too well but have talked to before. My best friend said I have a fun personality and can always cheer people up. The second person said I have a contagious laughter that always makes people happy.

The third person said that some of the best moments they had were when they got to school in the mornings and I was sat there, always ready to greet them with a smile and a nice conversation. 

I almost cried. These were incredibly nice things that they seemed to genuinely mean them. I had no idea they thought these things about me.

The one that hit me the most was the last one, because every time I had talked to that person, I had thought I seemed awkward and that they only talked to me to be polite. I didn't think they liked me at all.

This really made my day both yesterday and today and I just had to vent so here I am. It really reminded me that I need to be nicer to myself, and I hope I can remember that in the future.

It also made me think that people should let others know the nice impressions they have of them. Too many of us think it's gonna be awkward or weird to be nice to each other, when normally it's just really wholesome and sweet.

This has gotten way too long but oh well.

It is plastic injection molding which I have no experience with. Upon arrival of my new job, I had trouble finding the place because it was night time. Then I realized I was standing right in front of it. I saw two guys standing outside, the supervisor and the team leader. I said to them ""hi, today is my first day. I don't know which door I'm supposed to enter."" The team leader said my name in question. I said yes, thats me. And then he points to the door behind him. I walk in and have no idea where to go. So i just keep walking until I find the break room. There's people in there. I open the door and say hi to everyone and then put my lunch in the fridge. Then I tell everyone that this is my first day and I don't know where to go. A guy said that I was in the right location because the break room is where we all meet up before our shift starts and the team leader and supervisor will be in there to tell us where to go. 

When I told the team leader that I didnt have any factory experience, he rolled his eyes. He also got mad when I said I didn't have a pen or safety glasses. I didn't know that we needed to bring that because my recruiter never told me. I also could not ask him questions. I would ask him questions as he was demonstrating things to me and he just kept cutting me off. Then at orientation which was after my shift, he told me when he is demonstrating things to me, he wants my full and undivided attention and that I was not allowed to ask him questions until after he was finished showing me how to do things. 

I asked him about the different things I would be doing each day. Yesterday, i was trimming the excess of these plastic things that go under cars and they were complaining how i was going too slow and that it didn't have to be perfect. I had to trim those plastic things all day yesterday which was sooo boring and exhausting. And it was 1000 degrees in there. But when I asked him about the different roles, he said its best if i just do them instead of him explaining it to me. I asked him how long do you think it will take for me to understand all the positions here if I don't have any experience in this field. He said that entirely depends on me. He said the supervisor is only going to give me a couple days to see if I'm qualified. I asked him if the job was difficult. He said to him it's just common sense. For others, it may be harder because not everyone has common sense. 

The team leader and supervisor seem like douchebags to me. They charge you for anything that you might accidentally break. Torches, glasses, tools, etc. They did not introduce themselves when I first arrived looking for the place. And no one is really allowed to talk to the supervisor because he's not a ""people person"". I'm just thinking, then why are you a supervisor. They are also very quick to getting upset. Which intimidates me because I know I make a lot of mistakes. 

One of my coworkers also gave me a hard time in the break room after introducing myself. She said her name was BriBri or something like that. I said my name is (name) and she made fun of me for speaking the way I do since I'm a black girl but speak properly. She started mocking my voice. She asked me where I'm from. I said ""here"". Then she said ""Omg, I like totally figured."" She was a 40 year old woman.

But my coworkers picking on me is the last thing on my mind because I'm already so depressed and have came to the conclusion that I'm unattractive and worthless that I just don't care about being bullied anymore. 

However, this job just seems like too much. There's this 19 year old girl who works there. But she has factory experience. And there are plenty of other people my age that work there but I believe they have experience. 

My issue is I don't think I'll understand and have this job down pat within the time they want me to. I'm a slow learner and it takes me a while to understand concepts. And I'm really not a big fan of the supervisor and team leader and their lack of communication skills and respect. 

I have another interview today. If I get that job, i think I will take it. But if not, I don't know if I should stay at this job because it's already driving me nuts. What would you do? 

I will probably regret not taking the time to learn plastic injection molding because I hate not knowing how things work but at the same time, it's not that deep. 

And if i don't decide to come in tonight, should I let my supervisor know that I quit even if only working there for a day?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I started my new job yesterday. It is plastic injection molding which I have no experience with. Upon arrival of my new job, I had trouble finding the place because it was night time. Then I realized I was standing right in front of it. I saw two guys standing outside, the supervisor and the team leader. I said to them &amp;quot;hi, today is my first day. I don&amp;#39;t know which door I&amp;#39;m supposed to enter.&amp;quot; The team leader said my name in question. I said yes, thats me. And then he points to the door behind him. I walk in and have no idea where to go. So i just keep walking until I find the break room. There&amp;#39;s people in there. I open the door and say hi to everyone and then put my lunch in the fridge. Then I tell everyone that this is my first day and I don&amp;#39;t know where to go. A guy said that I was in the right location because the break room is where we all meet up before our shift starts and the team leader and supervisor will be in there to tell us where to go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I told the team leader that I didnt have any factory experience, he rolled his eyes. He also got mad when I said I didn&amp;#39;t have a pen or safety glasses. I didn&amp;#39;t know that we needed to bring that because my recruiter never told me. I also could not ask him questions. I would ask him questions as he was demonstrating things to me and he just kept cutting me off. Then at orientation which was after my shift, he told me when he is demonstrating things to me, he wants my full and undivided attention and that I was not allowed to ask him questions until after he was finished showing me how to do things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked him about the different things I would be doing each day. Yesterday, i was trimming the excess of these plastic things that go under cars and they were complaining how i was going too slow and that it didn&amp;#39;t have to be perfect. I had to trim those plastic things all day yesterday which was sooo boring and exhausting. And it was 1000 degrees in there. But when I asked him about the different roles, he said its best if i just do them instead of him explaining it to me. I asked him how long do you think it will take for me to understand all the positions here if I don&amp;#39;t have any experience in this field. He said that entirely depends on me.

I read through the backs of them and all the memories came flooding back. I would spend hours on these games, and they were *hard*. For anyone who doesn't know, they are point-and-click adventure games where you'd play as Nancy Drew. You'd have to interview characters, explore the settings around you for clues, and solve a bunch of puzzles to solve some sort of mystery.

I don't think I was able to get through any of them without looking at a guide at least a few times. I was, however, 10 at the time, so I decided to load one up and see if they stood up today. I chose Curse of Blackmoor Manor because I remember that was one that I could never finish.

Even though it was an older game, it aged really well in my opinion! I was able to get through without a guide, but the puzzles were still challenging enough that I found myself stuck a few times. I definitely didn't breeze through it. You had to buy into it a bit, but the story was interesting and enjoyable if you can get over some of the unrealistic parts of it.

I've been browsing r/nancydrew, but otherwise I don't really see much mention of the series elsewhere on Reddit. It's a very big series, with 32 games (and a 33rd in October!) throughout 21 years.

3 weeks ago I was at a job interview and I got the job. It would have been a summer job because I'm a student and I use my break for working. My family is very poor so I was happy that I got the job so i can support my father. I'm also in dept so I needed the job even more.

This guy told me that I should come the next week again so we can talk about everything like the payment and so on. But unfortunately I got very sick , I got a lung infection and was in the hospital until yesterday.

Today I went to him so we can talk about it.
But all he said was that I can go, he gave the job to another one who showed up earlier than me to talk about it. In addition he told me that the other girl is much better at the job (it's a job as a waitress... i worked as a waitress before and i qualified for the job) and could work before the school break starts which is impossible for me. He also gave her the job about two days after I told him I'm in the hospital.

I dont understand this. I told him that I am in the hospital so I can't come and I told him at the interview that I cannot work during school, only at the weekend. 
This was all fine, he said it will be okay. But I'm just angry that he havent told me earlier. He has my phone number and he has WhatsApp, a simple message would have been enough for me so I can look for another job. He isn't dumb, he knows how WhatsApp works.


Its 2 weeks till my school break starts and normally it would be impossible to find something. Where I live, summer jobs are very rare.

But (luckily?) I found something other just 3 h ago because of a friend of my sister, also as a waitress but I don't like the people there. But I need the job and the money so I go with this.

I feel like confessing when I swing by his town again next month, but I feel scared that he'll react badly and it'll ruin our friendship. 

The reason that I think he'll react badly is :
1) I'm not his type physically ( I'm below average looking at best and fugly at worst).
2) I'm the one who initiates the conversations (but the both of us ARE socially reserved, with him being more so than me I think), and I always reply longer only to be replied with short sentences - is that a sign?
3) A lot of our conversations on social media are short, with him leaving me on seen/blueticked despite the fact I ask him semi important questions sometimes (we're in the same field, so I try to keep up with his work occasionally). 
I feel like he doesn't want to chat or talk with me, and I also feel like I'm being too clingy or something.
4) I think that he'll think that all of our communications are just me being dishonest trying to get him.

I'll just be freaking honest, rejection is NOT the thing I'm most afraid of; I'll just cry alone for a week and then try to move on. But it's the loss of a friend is what I fear most - he's such a great, gentle and good person; and I feel like the friendship we've bulit via our shared work and interests is a huge part of why I'm so scared to lose him - he means so much more to me than just a friend, and losing someone like that feels unbearable to me.

That&amp;#39;s the problem these days - when someone disagrees with you they try to silence you which isn&amp;#39;t conducive to getting a proper discussion going. If there&amp;#39;s a disagreement then it&amp;#39;s shouldn&amp;#39;t be insults that people reply with but an articulated and well formed argument designed to try to change your point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

(No, that kid isnt me)

I was around 8 yo and i was fucking mad at that tv host, and sad and confused. I didnt understand how can you laugh at someone for getting orange for christmas, a kid, and on national tv. And since that day, whenever someone mentioned that host by name, i would say ""im gonna spit that mf if i ever see him"".
I must have some emotional trauma from that.

Fast forward to today. Wife asked me if im going with her to a mutual friend's single promotion. She helped him with video directing and she edited the video, so itd be nice if she was there. And since she started her music career not long ago, its also good place for networking and sht.

Well, i said ""ofc ill come with you"".
Next thing she sad was ""you know, that ""santa"" is hosting the promotion, ill understand if you spit him""

Oh my god. I cant explain what i was feeling at that moment. Oooooh, im gonna spit that mf, im not gonna introduce myself to him, talk to him, should i even go, i dont care if i make a scene, but my wife might get bad rep because of that, i could fuck up everything she achieved so far, fuck me.

We went there, and i saw ""santa"" as he entered, soon he came to introduce himself to us, he sat at our table and started talking with my us. And i was mad, and i was holding myself, and whenever i had to say something i was arrogant, but then i started listening, and he respects the guy that had promotion, hes interested in what my wife is talking, he shows respect to her, and her music and all, and that guys life is rough atm, but hes laughing about shit thats happening to him, hes positive and fun, and i stopped being arrogant, and started enjoying his company.

There was no spitting in the end, everything was good, everyone enjoyed, we met new people and i have nothing against that guy anymore.

I still think it was a shitty thing to laugh at that kid, but maybe it wasnt bad kind of laugh, maybe he didnt meant to be an asshat, maybe hes reacting like that to unusual situations, maybe he changed, maybe i remember it wrong, i dont know, all i know is that today was different and i feel different.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 25 years ago, day after christmas, i was watching tv.

1. Smell (Does it smell good?)
2. Taste (Does it taste good?)
3. Swallow (Does it go down smoothly?)

5. Purity (How much is it free from toxic shit?)

&lt;p&gt;This uphill battle that I am in with myself is very taxing, especially at nights like these when I miss her the most, but I&amp;#39;m still going to fight and be better than who I am right now. It is difficult, hella difficult but I&amp;#39;m trying, I just hope the pace I&amp;#39;m going at isn&amp;#39;t very slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lonliness truly is one of the worse things and due to my weird behavior(didn&amp;#39;t know it was adhd back then) it was difficult to make friends and when I made them, losing them is very difficult, losing the people I love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But something in me never let&amp;#39;s me quit even through this pain and hopelessness I feel I still have to see it through. I guess just to spite everyone hahaha, but yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: This is just a account I use to look at pretty girls online. Not my real one. :p&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m skeptical about this and I don&amp;#39;t believe in ghosts. The house hasn&amp;#39;t been used in years and has been visited by a few curious people. Someone told me they heard there&amp;#39;s a creepy doll at the second floor and people talk about it as if it&amp;#39;s a horror story for kids, we want to &amp;quot;debunk&amp;quot; this! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck. What&amp;#39;s your story about creppy houses/buildings?&lt;/p&gt;

I’m proud of you for making it this far, wether you’re 13, 19, anything in between or even younger or older, you’ve made it so far already. 

Life may be rough, it’s not supposed to be easy all the time, but if you’re in a good season in your life right now, take advantage of it. Reap the fruit of your efforts and continue pushing towards your next goal. Take this time to walk through the meadows and enjoy the peace you have while looking back on all your accomplishments. If you’re not in such a good season right now it’s okay, even if it doesn’t seem like it’s okay. Take this time to reflect on what you can do to get to your next goal, take this time to learn how to dance in the rain. Not every day is going to be exciting, but sometimes boring days are the best days, nothing to worry or stress about. So take advantage of these days. 

The average human lifespan consists of around 29,200 days. To put it into perspective, take your age and multiply that by 365. Does that amount of days scare you or worry you when subtracted from the average lifespan? Maybe it does, maybe it doesn’t, either way your life is precious and valuable. You never know when your time will come, so learn to fully embrace love, receive love, and give love. Life is too short to worry about stupid things. Have fun. Take risks. Send that text, call that person, apply for that college, tell them you love them. Before it’s too late.  So to whoever is reading this, I love you. Truly, I really do. You are a fascinating creature with so much potential, and wether you discover that said potential now or in some years down the road, you have the power and strength to accomplish your goals. 

I believe in you and your dreams. Don’t let anyone tell you that you’re not good enough or that you’re stupid or worthless, no one except you can define you. And sure, you’re not perfect, nobody is, but don’t strive to be anything but the best you can be in whatever you do. 

You may be struggling with something right now, but believe me, there is a light so bright and beautiful at the end of the tunnel and you’re so close to seeing the end, keep on pushing, you’re almost there! Whatever you do, don’t give up, this world has lost too many beautiful souls, we need you here on this planet, I need you here. You are destined to do great things. 

“If you are feeling low, or trampled, unappreciated, or forgotten...and you are reading this, realize it is an illusion...the hope is real...you are valued...and what lies ahead...is brilliance.” - Tom Althouse 

You. Are. Loved. 

Have a great night, sleep well, sleep in, have an amazing day. Don’t be afraid to be bold, to love others fully, to have fun and take risks. Stay safe in whatever you do, because your decisions now dictate your future, but enjoy your life, it’s yours and yours alone. If you like somebody, let them know. If you want something, ask for it. If you think something could be better, try to change it. I believe in you, you have the power to change the world.

You see this with guys like Jim Carey. Watch him in interviews, see when he's maniacally bouncing his foot or something? That's probably ADHD. I do it a lot. I sit while I'm working and I'm always swinging my legs, bouncing my foot, tapping with my hands, rocking in my chair etc.

This is relatively easily managed and actually pretty harmless.

No I'm talking about what's under the surface; how ADHD affects the lives of those of us afflicted on a deeper level.

I have a business meeting today with a client who's software I'm developing and my boss. I've known about this meeting for weeks so by the time I left the office yesterday, I had a plan:

I'd go home, prepare my lunch for today, then head off to gym for my workout, come home, eat dinner, play some games, shower, shave, clip my fingernails even and go to bed.

Sounds great right? Well I can tell you, it didn't work.

When I came home last night, the power was off so I couldn't prepare my lunch for today; I have microwave noodles with 0 nutritional value. Because the power was out and I couldn't make my lunch I figured I'd just go to gym; power was out there too, but I still got through my workout. I had dinner and basically just went to bed.

It sounds stupid, right, but that issue of the power being off screwed up my whole rhythm for the entire evening and so I basically got nothing done. I only went to gym because I figured that by the time I got home, power would be back on. That's also why I stayed.

Thing with ADHD is that something which is otherwise completely irrelevant can just disrupt everything. 

So there's a bit of insight nobody asked for :P Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t mean the antsy nervous can&amp;#39;t sit still bouncing off the walls part; that&amp;#39;s just on the surface. You see this with guys like Jim Carey. Watch him in interviews, see when he&amp;#39;s maniacally bouncing his foot or something? That&amp;#39;s probably ADHD. I do it a lot. I sit while I&amp;#39;m working and I&amp;#39;m always swinging my legs, bouncing my foot, tapping with my hands, rocking in my chair etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is relatively easily managed and actually pretty harmless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No I&amp;#39;m talking about what&amp;#39;s under the surface; how ADHD affects the lives of those of us afflicted on a deeper level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a business meeting today with a client who&amp;#39;s software I&amp;#39;m developing and my boss. I&amp;#39;ve known about this meeting for weeks so by the time I left the office yesterday, I had a plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d go home, prepare my lunch for today, then head off to gym for my workout, come home, eat dinner, play some games, shower, shave, clip my fingernails even and go to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds great right? Well I can tell you, it didn&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I came home last night, the power was off so I couldn&amp;#39;t prepare my lunch for today; I have microwave noodles with 0 nutritional value. Because the power was out and I couldn&amp;#39;t make my lunch I figured I&amp;#39;d just go to gym; power was out there too, but I still got through my workout. I had dinner and basically just went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds stupid, right, but that issue of the power being off screwed up my whole rhythm for the entire evening and so I basically got nothing done. I only went to gym because I figured that by the time I got home, power would be back on. That&amp;#39;s also why I stayed.&lt;/p&gt;

For starters, I'm 17 and I've recently finished my sophomore year of high school. It's a school specialized for IT (Information Technology) and it's something I've dreamed about ever since I got my first computer. I'm well on my way on getting a CS degree and being a software engineering, I'm no genius, but I'm not a bad programmer for a 17 year old.

Anyways, my current path is, and it's been for the most of my life, finish high school, go to college and become an engineer. As I come from a poor family, it's a big goal for all of us, so big that my brother is the first one from our family to ever go to college.

Here comes hip hop. It's always been a part of my life. I remember that my first ""favorite"" song was Not Afraid by Eminem, and back then I didn't speak a single word of english.

From there I listened to various artists and I've stumbled upon two in particular, Russ and Rilès. Both of them wrote and produced one song a week for 2 years and 1 whole year, respectively.

This amazed me, that you could produce your own songs on the internet and you could make a career out of it. On the other hand, I realize both of them got *very* lucky because there are **A LOT** of rappers and artists putting in work and failing.

At the same time, a friend of mine started producing his songs and I'm just jealous. It's something I want to do, but I know it has no merit and nothing will ever come from it.

And I like programming, I really do. I always had a brain for problem solving and it's very challenging and rewarding. But whenever I see someone sing and rap, I always think what if I did it?

EDIT: Wow, thank you guys for so many warming responses. After reading all of them and after doing some introspection I've came to the conclusion that it's not all that binary. It's not I either make music and go big or I never even try. And sometimes you should just do it because it's fun. And that's what I'll do. I'll still focus on school, on programming, but I'll start making music. I've received a lot of advice and I'll just jump in. Thank you once again for all the responses, it really did shine a light on my perspective about things.

IMHO, relationships are a beautiful balancing act of people's wants/needs/desires, and how they are addressed/not addressed, all of which keep evolving with time/circumstances. 

It's up to the people involved to actually be the kind of partner they're expecting, and just be more empathetic.

But overall, I feel that we all need broadly the same things and if we ask a 1000 people what they're looking for in a partner, the answers are going to be very similar. So, ideally, it shouldn't be that difficult to make relationships ""work""....have I just oversimplified the whole interpersonal dynamic? Is it impossible to achieve?

It's compact, nice, has a good amount of tech, etc. It's not a very fast car, but I don't want to kill anyone, let alone myself, speeding and trying to show off. I want to be able to get rid of riding public transportation. So, if you guys can advise me on a car that's better than a Prius Prime, I'm all ears.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve been putting off Driving School for a very long time (should&amp;#39;ve taken it in high school, I&amp;#39;m 26 now) and I&amp;#39;m planning on getting my license very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

So, i'm building a laptop for myself, and i've been going through some brands and websites, but there's something i've noticed that has seriously annoyed/concerned me.  


Why can't i build or buy a laptop **without** a webcam?

&amp;#x200B;

Is it mandatory? Has it just become a norm that ""everyone"" wants, so it just became standard?  
Cause really, i know i don't speak for myself when i say i've never felt confortable having a camera pointing towards me while i'm going about my life online. I got used to it, i ignored it and tried not to pay much attention. But now that i'm for the first time building a computer for myself,

I really **don't** want a webcam and that just seems impossible nowdays.

&lt;p&gt;Edit: my operation went very well for the people asking. The doctor seemed more than happy with the result. I’m getting one bigger operation in a few months with the hope that I won’t keep getting operations every few months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for the positive messages. Really means a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

Her parents weren’t abusive, but they weren’t much better. Out first conversation we talked about it, and we agreed to spend every single day together after to comfort each other after that point, and we did. 

Maybe not every day, but close enough. We didn’t have friends, so we spent all our time together.

We’d go to bookstores, and Walmart, and parties we weren’t invited to, and everywhere and anywhere, and we’d spend the whole day together to avoid going home. At night, we’d go to her dads house and sleep there. 

It was the first time I remember being happy. It was the first time I remember being safe. I had been living in this terrible environment for years, and I never told anyone anything ever, ever, ever. I didn’t even tell her the first conversation we had, either. I would have black eyes and I’d lie to all the people at school about how it happened. I was bullied. I didn’t feel liked. I contemplated suicide everyday. I was waiting for college to get away, but she was the person that changed everything. 

Sometimes you just need one person to really be there for you. She was the first person that really liked me. She was the first person that I could truly call a friend. She was the first person that stood up for me. The first I cried to. The first person I really loved. 

We were like sisters? Family? I don’t have a word to describe it. We’d always say that we were the first person in each others lives, and no one would ever compare. We said we’d always be friends, and we really couldn’t imagine a time where that would change. 

Her mom said she didn’t like me, and that we were codependent and it was unhealthy, and she never talked to her again. But looking back she was right? We did everything together. We based what we wanted to do in the future based on what the other person wanted to do. We went to the same college. Not because it was what was best for our future, but because we wanted to be together. We unconditionally loved each other, and we went through everything together. We never really fought, either. Until the last year we were friends. 

Everything good that happened in her life was more important to me than it was to her. We just loved each other. I told her everything. There was nothing about me that she didn’t know, and it went both ways. We’d play horrible pranks on each other. We’d sit through classes together. We’d play all these stupids games, and go traveling together, and we never stopped talking. We talked so much, I wondered what we were scared of in the silence. We had so many plans for the future. One was moving to Seattle and getting an apartment together, and I’m glad to report that she’s living that dream. 

It’s weird looking back at it. The worst thing in my life wasn’t being abused by my parents. The worst thing to happen was losing my best friend, and I know I’ll be able to get through anything because I was able to move on from that. If you told 20 year old me that I wouldn’t be friends with her in a few years, I wouldn’t have believed you. I couldn’t ever imagine us not being friends. 

It really taught me that you should never make one person your entire world. 9/10, it won’t work out well. But I hope everyone experiences that in their lives. You all deserve to have a best friend that will accept you and go through everything with you. That will never judge you, and always wants to best for you. 

Here’s the letter:

hey, dude. i know we’re not really talking right now, but i want you to know that isn’t because i don’t care because i do. i always will. 

i’ll always miss you when you aren’t around but i’m too proud to tell you that. i miss our stupid games. you’re the only one that will humor me and play and trust me i’m aware that you don’t like playing twenty rounds of “what character am i” but you only do it because you know i love it. i miss telling you everything about my day even the stupid stuff that no one else would cares to hear and i miss hearing everything about yours. i miss telling you outlandish stories about when we grew up even though we both know i’m full of shit and none of that happened. i miss you telling me about this new fantiction you read and pretending to hate it but secretly i think it’s the funniest thing ever and i miss your bad driving and i miss watching terrible horror movies together and i miss the youtube binges and going to dinner every tuesday and cracking up because we both always know how to make the other laugh and damn i just miss you 

i’m scared thinking that we’ll never talk again. i’ll never see you become a doctor. i’ll never see you have kids. i’ll never see you go grey and get wrinkles and i’ll have missed all those years but i know i’m kidding myself. if there’s one thing that i’m always a hundred percent sure of it’s that i’ll always keep ur eyes in my life. it doesn’t matter how much times goes by or how terribly we fight. you’re my best friend my family and basically my soulmate and i’ll always love you. always 


I cried when I read this, but I also laughed because it’s insanely ironic. I compare friends I have now to that, and I know I’ll never be that close to a person again. I’ll never find a friend like that again, and I’m honestly okay with it.

Bit of a background- I am 20 years old and female from Australia. I’ve lived a bit of a sheltered life. The only child of immigrant parents, somewhat religious family. I went to private school with parents who worked full time. So I’m sheltered in that sense too. Since finishing high school I have had depression and have found it really hard to make friends at University. No boyfriend, no anything. All conversations in therapy have led to problem of not having solid friendships, and me being completely social awkward, the cringe talkative kind, from basically living a sheltered life with low social interaction. 

So I decided to apply for exchange to the Netherlands to get myself out of the blues and to really challenge myself. I got in, but now I’m petrified. And I leave in a month and will be living there 6-12 months, depending how I go. 

I will be living with people my own age for the first time in my life, living without parents for the first time. And me being my awkward self I am worried that I won’t make any friends and I’ll be alone and even more depression in a foreign country. I am so so scared I have considered cancelling being I don’t know if I can do it. 


So to all the only children- tips for living with people for the first time?

To all the social awkward people out there, any tips?


To all the former sheltered people, what did you do to come out of your bubble? And tips on being less naive?

Was supposed to be going on two week vacation on Saturday 15th. Had planned it for about a year. Already paid £2.5k.

On Friday 14th got a message from my on off ex (met online, eventually met in person, long distance, age gap, complicated) saying she can’t do it anymore and blocked me. Later turned out she’s started seeing another guy. Today she posted to Instagram and tagged him so I got to see a picture of the happy couple (on his page). So that was nice. 

Later on Friday got a call from my dad that I urgently needed to come home (family home) as my mum might not survive the night. She’s been fighting liver cancer since last jan but went downhill really really quickly after getting an infection. 

So now am home with family about to lose my mum any time now - the best woman in the world. Feeling guilty as fuck cos I can’t concentrate on her cos I also feel like I’ve just lost the only girl who ever loved me. 

Family don’t know about girl so can’t really bring it up.

Hey, hey, facebook folks! I'm gonna take a step out of my comfort zone to get something off my chest that I've wanted to talk about for a while now, and even at one point didn’t ever want to talk about at all! I’m hoping that this is a step towards feeling more comfortable and open with myself!

My name is ciaraft, and I'm asexual. As far as I can tell, I've been this way for quite some time, but only started to become aware of it within the last year or so. By that I mean that I simply don't have any interest in sex like the average person might. I figured that Pride Month is the perfect opportunity, given that asexuality is experienced by an estimated 1% of the population, but hello, we’re out here!! 

At the end of the day it's our differences that make us who we are and it really shouldn't be this difficult for people to embrace them. In this day and age, embracing love and spreading it like confetti in any capacity is paramount to spreading hatred. We all deserve to feel loved, self-love included.

And a quick reminder for all of my closeted, or out LGBTQIA+ pals; You are good. You are whole. You are lovable.  Other people’s feelings do not affect your worth. 

Below are a couple links in regards to asexuality, if you’re interested in reading a little bit more! I’m also open to questions, of course, but all I ask for is kindness as I put this out into the world!

College was a great time for me. 

I dont mean in the way that I was particularly good at studies, or that I did well in physical activities, or I had crazy good relationships or anything such. 

I spent a very normal, calm, relatively-stress free, carefree four years at a decent college getting my engineering degree. 

I'm from India, so here, we really really really have to grind it out in grades 11 and 12 (dunno what you call it around the world, but essentially the two years prior to university). So my outlook going into the college of my choice was essentially to relax for four full years. 

And so I did! 
I had the time of my life - enjoying late nights dorm debates, routinely missing meals only to fill up with bags of chips and cans of Coke while binging Breaking Bad, drinking my liver to shit, performing a lot of music, all while sneaking some solid studying between all of that. 

And now, one year after I've graduated, things are, well, different. They're not bad, I'm lucky to have a well-paying job, I'm still in touch with my friends, financial freedom is a huge plus. 

All of sudden it seems like those four years were some pleasant dream. 
Like they never existed.
Like the six o' clock sunset and the countless glasses of lemonade vodka still is a fantasy. 
Like the 3AM Oreo binges, with lab work due the next day lying unattended, while you argue with your mates why ghosts definently exist, was never really real.

I'm not sad about it; I just feel hard to believe that something so carefree and easy ever was my life.

&lt;p&gt;And now, one year after I&amp;#39;ve graduated, things are, well, different. They&amp;#39;re not bad, I&amp;#39;m lucky to have a well-paying job, I&amp;#39;m still in touch with my friends, financial freedom is a huge plus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of sudden it seems like those four years were some pleasant dream. 
Like they never existed.
Like the six o&amp;#39; clock sunset and the countless glasses of lemonade vodka still is a fantasy. 
Like the 3AM Oreo binges, with lab work due the next day lying unattended, while you argue with your mates why ghosts definently exist, was never really real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sad about it; I just feel hard to believe that something so carefree and easy ever was my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you feel that too?&lt;/p&gt;

If you're reserved and keep yourself to yourself, people will either think you're rude or weird.

&amp;#x200B;

It's my natural impulse to keep my mouth closed in public unless there's something/someone I'm really interested in. I've been doing the opposite for a while now and it makes things easier. I recently started a new job and I've seen what happens when you regress into a mute-like state. You may end up relinquishing your freedom if you choose to stay silent. You gotta communicate. For an introvert or anxious person, this might be hard but it's the only way. People will simply compound your anxiety issues if you don't. Retreating intensifies interest. 

&amp;#x200B;

The objective when interacting with strangers is to make them feel comfortable in your company. The best way to do that is to ask questions, show interest, maybe crack a few jokes and smile. This kinda goes against my nature, but in order to survive in this world I must be the ""cheery guy"". 

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re reserved and keep yourself to yourself, people will either think you&amp;#39;re rude or weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s my natural impulse to keep my mouth closed in public unless there&amp;#39;s something/someone I&amp;#39;m really interested in. I&amp;#39;ve been doing the opposite for a while now and it makes things easier. I recently started a new job and I&amp;#39;ve seen what happens when you regress into a mute-like state. You may end up relinquishing your freedom if you choose to stay silent. You gotta communicate. For an introvert or anxious person, this might be hard but it&amp;#39;s the only way. People will simply compound your anxiety issues if you don&amp;#39;t. Retreating intensifies interest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective when interacting with strangers is to make them feel comfortable in your company. The best way to do that is to ask questions, show interest, maybe crack a few jokes and smile. This kinda goes against my nature, but in order to survive in this world I must be the &amp;quot;cheery guy&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve adopted all these mantras and codes to live by but they aren&amp;#39;t true. Be yourself is a crock of bull. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make the other person comfortable - this is the only code you need.&lt;/p&gt;

Little back story for context.

Im M20 and I first shaved my head at age of 14. It was my go to style for 5 years. In those 5 years everyone knew me as the [Name ""bald guy"" Surname]. It was kinda my thing. 
My life in those 5 years was pretty good. I had no problem with study and motivation. I would get things done and even do extra. I even have short movie and few theater shows directed for school. Amateur level, not much but honest work haha. All that time I was achieving something and was regulary happy with life. Ofc some bad things came with this style. Some people would judge me on first look, saying I look like a hooligan and etc. Even police took extra measures on traffic controls. Still it was all good and I didn't mind.

Now 1 year ago some of my family really wanted me to grow hair before graduation and prom. I was kinda sceptical because you can't be ""that bald guy"" if you have hair. Took me bit of negotiations but I finally agreed. 

Now here is the important part. First few months were okay. I had no problem with me having hair but... It was time to sign up for college and my family wanted me to keep hair so I don't get judged as mentioned before. I agreed to that. Thank God I got accepted to Pharmacy college in my city and that was really great achivement, but guess what. Something just felt odd. I wasn't even happy. I felt weird all the time. Few months in on college and my self motivation was 0. I failed so many exams and badly suprised myself and family. Depression was knocking on the doors but I had no clue why. Literally I had everything I wanted but couldn't bring myself up. At the time I didn't realised. But I wasn't in control of my life.
My hair made me so much other person. My relationship with new people I met was so different  than before. I behaved so strange and was influenced by that greatly.
Now you might wonder, mate why haven't you shaved already if it was so important to you ?!
I didn't realise it impacted me so much and my family loved my hairstyle that they wouldn't let me shave it. My uncle even said he wouldn't speak to me if I shaved ever again. Weird huh.

So again few months after in 2nd semester, situation is getting worse. Barely passing any exams, mostly failing and I simply couldn't bring myself up. You might know this feeling. Everything is fine but you can't even get up from bed ? Mindless scrolling trough social apps and achieving nothing. Ye that was it.

Well it hit me few weeks ago. I hit so low in my life I just had to make a change. Hours of thinking and I realised. Everything was super cool when I was me. Bald guy in control of life. Doing whatever I want to do (good stuff mostly) and not letting other decide for me. So decision was made. Im shaving my head and we will see from there.

My dear God. It was the best decision I made in last year of my life. Even minutes after shaving I felt so much diffrent. I honestly felt happy. Yes difficulties came with this decision. My family was suprised and uncle dissapointed. Some friends that havent knew me before were super suprised and proffesors gave me 2nd looks but guess what. It was 1/1 worth it. This weekend I studied so much and it was great. I recon I will pass  this exam with no problem.My motivation is honestly trough the roof. Like it was all collecting itself in 1 year period and now it is realised. I get from bed easier, I eat better and healtier food, I interact with people so diffrently and I love it.

All of this because one simple thing, hair. 
Now what I would like you fellow redditor reading this to know.
For me it was hairstyle. For you it might be something else. But you need to know. You are incharge of you. Other just might help and guide but your decidion is final. Do what you want and what feels best for you as long as it doesn't greatly harm others. Remember when you felt good and try to embrace that and get even better.

Put yourself in this story. Change my role with yours and change my problem with yours. You just might get motivated and change your life for greater good.

If you made this far thank you for reading. This would be my cakeday post and I wish you all, best of luck!!!

So I’m a [30F] and I went on the pill last year for my iron. It ended up dramatically shifting my hormones so much that I got really depressed and my thinking for really dark which is extremely out of character for me. 

A bit about me - I have a masters, an amazing career where I earn above market rate, I love my job, my boss loves my work, I have tonnes of friends and can be a lot of fun- I’m the funny one and the one you go to for help. And I’ve been single for a really long time, but have been online dating and had a fwb who didn’t treat me well (and face it no guy I’ve been with has been kind), but I also didn’t think I deserved to be treated better either, so I put up with a lot.  I honestly have never felt loved by anyone and I so desperately just wanted to love someone but I just couldn’t see anyone wanting to be with me. 

The pill made me feel my loneliness and sadness so much more intensely than I have ever felt darkness before. I was crying everyday. I kept it together st work by listening to music through headphones as loud as I could to stay as distracted from my thoughts. And this was my default to stop myself bursting into tears all the time. I’m not a crier so this was really frustrating for me. 

After 7-8 months on the pill. I decided that  I was sick of my life being in the same year in and year out whilst everyone was growing and moving on. And if by March next year nothing had changed and I was in the same place for yet another year in a row like it had been for a good part of a decade then I was ending it. 

I talked to a lawyer, I started to get my affairs in order, insurance, debt, all the little details. And decided I was going to work like hell to save as much as I could so I could help my friends and family as much as I could. I worked out more because I felt like I didn’t want people to think my life was in stand still because I was unfit or overweight and depressed because of that. Because i wasn’t. I’m happy in my skin.  I became more social because my count down was on. I had one year to make the most of my friends because next year I will be gone. 

I planned a holiday. I was going to do it overseas, so I stayed to decide where I was going to visit. Maybe meet some online friends for the first time (if they were crazy it didn’t matter, the end goal was to die anyway)  and do a few last bucket list things.

But here’s the thing. The more I put things in order for my death. The less stressed I felt. I felt more in control of my life than I ever had before. 

And I started feeling happier. 

After seeing my savings grow all of a sudden I realised owning a house is actually within grasp. It’s not a hopeless cause.  I’m now in control of my finances and they’re thriving. 

My social life is amazing because I’m putting my energy into other people. My friendships are under control and thriving 

My fitness has improved. I’ve lost 8kgs, running 10kms reg with a new group every week. I’m looking cuter and getting lots of compliments. My health is under control and thriving. 

I haven’t been on the pill for 3 months. I’m managing my iron other ways and I’m no longer crying, or depressed. My mental health is under control and thriving. 

My perspectives of things changed. I started seeing things through the lens of “is this going to matter April 2020”? No? Don’t stress about it.   So my confidence grew - if something was shit st work i stood up for myself. I got more responsibilities and a pay rise. Because I wasn’t afraid anymore. Because what was stressing me out stopped being AS important. I’m in control of what happens to me in my career and it’s thriving - I have more opportunity than ever before. 

This is my favourite bit. 
I met someone. We have been dating for just over a month. There’s real potential here but I’ve met someone that could become my best friend. He respects me and cares about me. He is interesting and hes interested in me. Helps me, supports me, compliments me. He is doing everything he can to show he thinks the world of me. Everyday he tells me how awesome he thinks I am. I’m so blessed. I have someone who will hold me and hug me and I know he has my back. I’m finally safe. 

I haven’t ever had this my entire life. No guy has treated me so kindly before I can barely process how great it is. I don’t know how it happened. I was going to kill myself I was so convinced it was never going to happen. And out of the blue it did. 

If you’re close to giving up. Trust me. I GET IT. 
But please don’t. Your life can turn around in a MOMENT. 7 weeks ago I was THE BIGGEST skeptic out there.... and now I can’t imagine not being here for what else life has for me. I got dealt a rough hand of cards in my life, but it’s turned around in a heartbeat. It’s going to be ok. You’re going to be ok.


EDIT: Omg I can’t believe this resonated with so many people and thank you so much for the gold and silver. What marvellous kind people!! Thank you x 

Just from some comments, I wanted to clarify that I didn’t finish achieving my goals, The progress I’ve made has been over a long period. But feeling “happy” again has been very quick. 

1. I have been sad and lonely for many years, the contraceptive pill added a whole layer of crazy and disturbing, dark, suicidal thoughts and I was starting to think and behave out of character. Once I stopped it I am in a better place. My goals are helping me stop being sad and lonely in the first place and I’m coming out the other side and still have a long way to go. But I’m seeing life is worth living. 

2. Those things making me sad and lonely are the reasons why I want(ed) to die. I’ve been raped, had awful deaths in the family under really stressful and scary circumstances, been fired numerous times and bullied in toxic work environments and had an abusive and violent boyfriend who put me in hospital a few times.  I’m also really tired of every year looking and feeling the same as every year before and want to be in a new season, having a family and having a partner. Not reliving Groundhog Day every year for the rest of my existence. No thanks. Over it. Need things to change - which is why I started my goals. If I can make my life look different then I will keep living - and I can see they’re really working 

I’ve noted the really good things above (job, friends etc) because I want to focus on the things I have to live for - and are things I’ve worked very hard for. I didn’t mean for it to be a humble brag or anything - I’m just trying to rewire my brain to focus on these things rather than the former - which were getting me nowhere, fast. 

3. I met someone because I spent less time on online friendships and invested more in people I could actually meet and spend time with. It is also part magic and total luck too.  I am don’t living my life through a screen. It is so isolating and lonely. I have made wonderful friends, and I want to maintain them - but not to the degree of hours and hours everyday - the people in my life in person need a bigger investment from me, and it’s really paying off and having a positive impact on me seeing my self worth x","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to share my story because I think it could help someone &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m a [30F] and I went on the pill last year for my iron. It ended up dramatically shifting my hormones so much that I got really depressed and my thinking for really dark which is extremely out of character for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 7-8 months on the pill. I decided that  I was sick of my life being in the same year in and year out whilst everyone was growing and moving on. And if by March next year nothing had changed and I was in the same place for yet another year in a row like it had been for a good part of a decade then I was ending it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I talked to a lawyer, I started to get my affairs in order, insurance, debt, all the little details. And decided I was going to work like hell to save as much as I could so I could help my friends and family as much as I could. I worked out more because I felt like I didn’t want people to think my life was in stand still because I was unfit or overweight and depressed because of that. Because i wasn’t. I’m happy in my skin.  I became more social because my count down was on. I had one year to make the most of my friends because next year I will be gone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I planned a holiday. I was going to do it overseas, so I stayed to decide where I was going to visit. Maybe meet some online friends for the first time (if they were crazy it didn’t matter, the end goal was to die anyway)  and do a few last bucket list things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here’s the thing. The more I put things in order for my death. The less stressed I felt. I felt more in control of my life than I ever had before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I started feeling happier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After seeing my savings grow all of a sudden I realised owning a house is actually within grasp. It’s not a hopeless cause.  I’m now in control of my finances and they’re thriving. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My social life is amazing because I’m putting my energy into other people. My friendships are under control and thriving &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fitness has improved. I’ve lost 8kgs, running 10kms reg with a new group every week. I’m looking cuter and getting lots of compliments. My health is under control and thriving. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t been on the pill for 3 months. I’m managing my iron other ways and I’m no longer crying, or depressed. My mental health is under control and thriving. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My perspectives of things changed. I started seeing things through the lens of “is this going to matter April 2020”? No? Don’t stress about it.   So my confidence grew - if something was shit st work i stood up for myself. I got more responsibilities and a pay rise. Because I wasn’t afraid anymore. Because what was stressing me out stopped being AS important. I’m in control of what happens to me in my career and it’s thriving - I have more opportunity than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my favourite bit. 
I met someone. We have been dating for just over a month. There’s real potential here but I’ve met someone that could become my best friend. He respects me and cares about me. He is interesting and hes interested in me. Helps me, supports me, compliments me. He is doing everything he can to show he thinks the world of me. Everyday he tells me how awesome he thinks I am. I’m so blessed. I have someone who will hold me and hug me and I know he has my back. I’m finally safe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t ever had this my entire life. No guy has treated me so kindly before I can barely process how great it is. I don’t know how it happened. I was going to kill myself I was so convinced it was never going to happen. And out of the blue it did. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re close to giving up. Trust me. I GET IT. 
But please don’t. Your life can turn around in a MOMENT. 7 weeks ago I was THE BIGGEST skeptic out there.... and now I can’t imagine not being here for what else life has for me. I got dealt a rough hand of cards in my life, but it’s turned around in a heartbeat. It’s going to be ok. You’re going to be ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Omg I can’t believe this resonated with so many people and thank you so much for the gold and silver. What marvellous kind people!! Thank you x &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just from some comments, I wanted to clarify that I didn’t finish achieving my goals, The progress I’ve made has been over a long period. But feeling “happy” again has been very quick. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been sad and lonely for many years, the contraceptive pill added a whole layer of crazy and disturbing, dark, suicidal thoughts and I was starting to think and behave out of character. Once I stopped it I am in a better place. My goals are helping me stop being sad and lonely in the first place and I’m coming out the other side and still have a long way to go. But I’m seeing life is worth living. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those things making me sad and lonely are the reasons why I want(ed) to die. I’ve been raped, had awful deaths in the family under really stressful and scary circumstances, been fired numerous times and bullied in toxic work environments and had an abusive and violent boyfriend who put me in hospital a few times.  I’m also really tired of every year looking and feeling the same as every year before and want to be in a new season, having a family and having a partner. Not reliving Groundhog Day every year for the rest of my existence. No thanks. Over it. Need things to change - which is why I started my goals. If I can make my life look different then I will keep living - and I can see they’re really working &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve noted the really good things above (job, friends etc) because I want to focus on the things I have to live for - and are things I’ve worked very hard for. I didn’t mean for it to be a humble brag or anything - I’m just trying to rewire my brain to focus on these things rather than the former - which were getting me nowhere, fast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I met someone because I spent less time on online friendships and invested more in people I could actually meet and spend time with. It is also part magic and total luck too.  I am don’t living my life through a screen. It is so isolating and lonely. I have made wonderful friends, and I want to maintain them - but not to the degree of hours and hours everyday - the people in my life in person need a bigger investment from me, and it’s really paying off and having a positive impact on me seeing my self worth x&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

That said, I’ve been thinking recently that I  exclusively watch anime entertainment these days. I just find that anime can convey certain topics and plot lines better than live action. For example in my favourite film of all time, I want to eat your pancreas, there’s a scene that incorporates the world of le petit prince and in the context of the film it’s very powerful and brought me to tears. However, that plot line couldn’t be expressed that way in live action as it would just be cringe and weird.

&lt;p&gt;That said, I’ve been thinking recently that I  exclusively watch anime entertainment these days. I just find that anime can convey certain topics and plot lines better than live action. For example in my favourite film of all time, I want to eat your pancreas, there’s a scene that incorporates the world of le petit prince and in the context of the film it’s very powerful and brought me to tears. However, that plot line couldn’t be expressed that way in live action as it would just be cringe and weird. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just feel that anime can express things in a way that evokes a lot of emotion, along with the music, a lot better than live action can. Anyone else feel this way or have any thoughts on it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is everyone else doing? What language(s) are you learning and how long? What have been the challenges of learning your chosen language? Why did you chose it?&lt;/p&gt;

I am a 19 year old male from Czechia (Central Europe). I just graduated high school with flying colours and decided to try applying for med school and also for chemistry.

I never really wanted to persuade the career of a medic but my family and friends always told me that I would be good for med school and that there is no better school than that. But I never really felt like I could be and wanted to be a doctor. But I didn't want to disappoint anyone in my family, so I applied for med school. But here comes the bummer.

I don't think of myself as a good student but my teachers and friends think otherwise. I won some competitions on national level in natural sciences and I never had problems with learning. School has always been easy for me and that's the problem. I thought of myself that I knew everything, that I didn't need to study much for the entry test because I just passed final exams (think something like A-levels or SATs) from Biology and Chemistry both with grade A (highest possible). And both subjects are essential for med school. So I just tried out some entry tests from previous years and did quite good. Or I thought that I did quite good.

Then the entry test came. And it was a lot harder than I expected. So I failed on all 3 med schools. But I didn't think of it as much of a disappointment because I didn't really wanted to study it. But the last three days I just can't stop thinking about it, about trying it again and really becoming a doctor and saving lives of people.

I just don't know what to do at this point. I have almost 3 months of holidays ahead of me which I would like to contribute to my personal growth and learning what I haven't known during the tests. And in mid September I will become a chemistry student which I never wanted to be even though my favourite science is chemistry. But I can't imagine myself working my whole life in a lab and achieving nothing.

So help me out and tell me if my thinking is right, that I should try applying for med school again next year and this time really preparing for the entry tests. Because I don't want to throw away all my biology knowledge which is almost useless at the chemistry school.

I apologize for any spelling and grammar mistakes, English isn't my mother tongue. And also please forgive my wording of some sentences, it's almost half past midnight where I live so I may be a little sleepy and ignorant about it. Also posting from mobile, so excuse any bad formatting.

I was mildly depressed for a few months (would sleep all day, skip classes, avoid human interaction), and I realised social media was really affecting my mood. It would add to my depression. After talking to my dad about my depression, I changed my lifestyle slowly. However I was still using social media and would feel down.

Consequently, I deleted my social media last week, and it's been so much better. I realised that social media is the most un-social thing there is. Nobody cares if you went bowling with your boyfriend Sophia. Yet people do care, because for them they think that Sophia and her boyfriend are perfect and without their flaws. Instagram was created to share photos, but who wants to share bad feelings with so many people? Social media has made us inept of making the difference between posts and real-life. In real life people struggle, on social media they don't. And I realised I was suffering from it, along with millions (maybe billions) of others. Sophia and her boyfriend probably aren't the perfect couple as their comments might suggest. No-one's perfect, but society has seemed to put certain people up on a pedestal for some reason. Others like myself have suffered because, personally speaking, I felt lost in my life with no direction. 

What I'm trying to say is social media isn't for everyone. Try a week without it, and focus on what YOU like to do. I started skateboarding because I snowboard during the winter months. I became from a person who always compared himself with society to someone who enjoys themselves. I realised that I'm stuck with myself, whether I like it or not, and that I should enjoy myself. I spent time with fake friends and cut them out my life and although I consider myself friend-less I feel like my life has taken a meaning becuase I compared me to myself (if it makes sense) and not to some fake posts people post.

What do you think of social media? Is it good? Is it bad? Are you 'successful' on socil media? Do/Did you suffer from it like I did?

&lt;p&gt;I feel sad most of the time because I didn&amp;#39;t get what I want and then one day I finally came to my senses and said &amp;#39;&amp;#39;fuck it, I only have one life&amp;#39;&amp;#39; I decided to change course and be what I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not easy to tell my parents because they want me to graduate on time, and said why I didn&amp;#39;t say it sooner and I told them because I was scared of them, etc etc. but I guess in the end, our parents want us to be happy and they let me take Culinary Arts(currently on 2nd year).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope y&amp;#39;all get what you want and thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

Having a roommate that didn't let me have people over and wouldn't go to class had such a bad effect on me. I ended up doing the same thing.

It feels good to finally feel positive about the future. I'm not really used to feeling so happy and excited and optimistic. I know that I still have a lot of work to do to make up for what I've done, but I will make my parents proud of me.

Peter is a guy I became friends with when I first started smoking weed. Think shaggy but welsh and wholesome.

So this weekend was great, the most fun I'd had in ages. But after maybe a week or two of being back in france, I was depressed again.

The christmas came around, and Peter came home for the holidays. One day I was at the pub with him, and for some reason Peter was talking about me being cool af. He said one sentence to me that reversed everything. He said I was one of the nicest people he knows. That hit me deep. That made me realise people like me, and I'm not a piece of shit.

Japan, at least the places I went to, was pretty much everything I thought it was but even more. Seeing not only the main touristy stuff (like the temples in Kyoto) but also the other tourists and the people who live there going about their daily life was definitely something worth seeing it.

Took me by surprise at first, but seemed much different than the normal commutes I've seen in New York.

 On top of that, the food in some places were especially amazing despite not being particularly expensive, there were convenience stores and vending machines pretty much everywhere, even in the restaurants they even had vending machines to order food. Funny though, the anime-themed restaurants in Tokyo especially seemed to have really long lines compared to your run of the mill small family-run place. 

A few other things I liked was having to climb a bunch of stairs to get to the temples, learning Shinto traditions, how well-kept the natural sites were, seeing people enthusiastic about their work, the politeness, the animal themed cafes, the maid cafes, the arcades, and the architecture.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a slight medical emergency (chest pains) about 2 weeks ago and I was taken to the ER because of it. It turned out nothing was wrong with me but after that day I started stressing out about the tiniest things in my body. I had multiple panic attacks over the course of a single day and that stretched on for about a week. I couldn't get any sleep because of it and my body felt like it was breaking down because I was panicking so much. I was constantly thinking of my own mortality and how I could die at any moment, going to sleep was a nightmare because I was worried I might not make it the next day.

Then because of my panic and stress my TMJ symptoms started flaring up and I started having massive headaches and my awareness felt like it was wavering sometimes. It was tough to clear my head and keep a calm mind, especially since I wasn't able to run during that week as well (because of an unrelated knee injury). I kept on worrying that my TMJ was a tumor and that stress and lack of sleep just made my symptoms even worse. I went to multiple dentists and doctors and it turns out that there was nothing out of the ordinary of my TMJ, but everyday felt like a struggle to keep myself motivated.

Those were some of the toughest times of life, my body feeling like it was out of control yet nothing being wrong with me, I felt like I wasn't able to keep on living like that. I was already feeling lost before the ER visit because I am about to graduate college and I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, but the panic and stress almost crippled me.

The only thing that really kept me through was messaging with my friends, finishing up chores around the house, reading wholesome posts and most importanly my mom.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom gave me rides to the doctors and dentists when I felt too weak to drive

My mom was always ready to listen to whatever I needed to say that day

My mom always went on bike rides with me so we could get some fresh air

My mom watched soothing anime with me whenever we had free time

&amp;#x200B;

Shes been there for me all the time, and even though these past couple weeks have been super tough on me, I'm glad that I was able to get even closer with her.

so, thank you mom!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Backstory for Context.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm on my way to my friends house, listening to music, a little high as i had just smoked up a bit (weed), and satisfied from some dollar items at [Fast Food Restaurant]. It's just a regular day in the life of OP and I'm minding my own business.

I get off the bus across the street from my friends house and lucky for me, the light has just turned green for me.
""What a nice surprise!"" I thought to myself, because usually I'd have to wait 10+ minutes for the light to change.

I start to walk across the street, looking towards my destination but noticing  that the two lanes to the left of the bus are currently empty (light just changed, bus was the first one there).
[To note, i can't really see if there are any cars coming because the bus was blocking a lot of the view, and also it's a red light, there's no way that any car would be going through it right? (it was a 3-way intersection)] |-

Those things above included with the fact that i was 
1) kinda stoned
2) listening to music in both ears
3) not paying as much attention as i should 
4) putting full trust in the idea that RED means STOP
I just continued to walk across the street.

Im about to pass the bus, literally steps away from the next lane over, and a car zooms past me.
He wasn't going too fast, not highway speeds, but definitely faster than ""I'm getting ready to stop at this red light"".
I didn't really take it in too much, i looked at him passing by me, but after a little bit i just resumed crossing the street.

I honestly didn't think of it too much until an older gentleman stopped me on the sidewalk and mentioned that i almost got hit but a car:
I pretty much said to him something like ""ya he almost hit me *shrugs*"", but looking back at it, he looked like he was really concerned for my safety.

I guess that close encounter was a lot closer than i thought 🤷‍♂️


Tl:dr

I was crossing the street and a car almost hit me when he was supposed to stop, the moment of, i didn't really care too much except for the fact that he ran a red light, but when a passerby stopped me to talk to me, i reconsidered how close i was to danger.

Drivers: Please drive safe! Please stop at red lights, and please watch out for pedestrians. Someone else might not be as lucky as me 

Pedestrians: Please watch your surroundings, look both ways before you cross the street, don't keep your head down while you walk.

Everyone: I guess it's pretty cliche to say this, but try to enjoy your life, and don't try your best not to take things for granted.

It was a picture that said something alone the lines of ""Your vegan diet is  not always cruelty free"", with a picture of immigrants and field workers with a woman in exercise clothes holding an apple stands above their heads. 

Now back to my grandfather, the only reason this stuck with me is because my grandfather was a field worker all his life. 


He was a field worker when he lived in Mexico, he was brought to the US through the bracero program, when he came to the US and got his citizenship, he continued his work. 

It was just a topic I hadn't really seen discussed. I'm totally for cruelty free animal products or cage free, even vegan. 

I've seen some companies being called to question about how they treat and pay their workers, but never on the level that animals do.

&amp;#x200B;

Mostly a lurker here but decided to post something. This may be a long one so buckle your seat belts friends!

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last couple years I've been feeling like I'm stuck in life with no way out. I've been trying my best to make changes to progress but usually end up in the same state of mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

A little background about myself, I \[24M\] battled depression all throughout high school and never really did much with my life. In my adult life, I go through waves of not necessarily depression, but just self doubt and guilt for some reason. Right out of high school I had enrolled in classes at a local community college. Due to anxiety and other personal problems I ended up dropping classes 2 weeks into each semester. I did this for about 4 semesters before giving up. This is probably one of my biggest regrets in life thus far. Got myself a steady job that paid pretty well so I could support myself without schooling. I liked it but I know my potential and this isn't for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to Aug 2018. I made a dumb decision and rolled my car over while intoxicated. Landed myself in jail for a night and a fancy OWI on my record. This really put my life into perspective and kick-started me into bettering myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here I am today. 54 days left of probation and then I'm a free man. I just put in an application to a local state university to try and get accepted as a freshman. I'm scared they wont accept my based on my prior experience at the community college but I don't know it works exactly. I do have a plan B is they don't and that would be to go back to community college and retake the courses I dropped so they don't show up on my transcript as dropped classes. But I would much rather go straight to university.

I called a few times and got no answer.  When I finally went to the store, one of the other keyholders/assistant manager told me what had happened.  That was crazy.  Also the manager is only 36 and got it from really bad genes.  

Anyway recently she went into the doctors and they said not to go to work for 2 weeks or so, because of the exertion on her heart.  She's always seems fine at work and she underplays how serious it is.  

Anyway last week we had inventory week which was intense. We were/are understaffed so we needed help from the other stores.  Smart me went to a bar crawl until 4am the night before.  Then I worked the next day at 1pm and finished at 10pm.  The following day we started at 5am to finish scanning the store before customers came in.  At 11am I was done, but then had to work the next 2 days.  It was a lot, but not too bad.

Because of my managers absence, we've been getting managers from all over the place for a few days at a time.   Some have been really damanding and some are corporate robots who do everything exactly by the book in fear of getting written up.  I should mention my original manager is my favorite.  She understands the millenial struggle and we agree on most things.  She' s pretty laid back and will let you coast a shift if you need to.  I don't get paid much, so she understands it doesn't make sense for me to be super fast and perfect.  I'm a human after all.  

Today I had the laziest manager.  I was really annoyed at her.  I worked harder and faster than normal so I wouldn't have to hear her complain or just hear her in general.  She made my brother go through so many hoops to get a family discount it was rediculous.  He needed to have a picture id with a shared address between us, proving we're under the same household to get the discount.  He tried to tell me to buy it, under my employee discount.  She wasn't having it, even though there's no difference.  He finally found some id she was willing to accept.  It was all so rediculous.  Oh and I say she was lazy because she saw me constantly doing something and kept adding more things while doing nothing herself.  When I left she said we probably won't see each other again.  Good riddance.  Some people just get so power hungry as a manager or they get way too serious and need to chill a little.

Today when I was strolling around a in a park, I walked past two stones. One was completely black and the other one was equally white (though to be as realistic as possible, the rain also intensified the colors). However, when I decided to pick them both up and turned around, standing in front of me was an pitch black dog with a white male (the owner). I took note of the occurrence and kept walking. The owner was following my path and was constantly walking behind me.  


I was listening to a song which I wanted to finish before calling a friend of mine, which was a completely random thought that I had before I started listening. When the song ended, I looked through my call history to find his number when he called me up instead, right before I found his number. I was surprised, told him about my intention of calling him, my findings and was told that he was thinking about calling me earlier today, though he simply decided to do it there and then.  


I looked back and noticed that the dog + male was still walking behind me. Shortly afterwards he chose another way, when my friend jokingly stated that ""I should offer him the stones"". At first I didn't give it a lot of thought since I believed I had lost him due to us splitting paths. But it just happened to be that he walked around a house and later on, appeared in front of me with his dog once again. That's when I had the thought of actually handing him the stones.   


I hesitated for a while, thinking if my superstitious self would actually want to give away such a treasure. But I decided that I would actually go through with it. The only thing that stopped me was the fact that I would have to run after him, since he had gotten quite far away from me by then. Though when I stopped to think if it was worth the run (while slowly walking towards him, he stopped and started doing something with his phone. I was encouraged to start to pick up my pace when he started walking again, which made me stop because I still wasn't sure if it was a good idea to give them away. He then stopped walking again and finally, I decided to start running and catch up with him.   


I get his attention, tell him about the stones and how him and his dog appeared at the same moment as I picked the stones up. I proceeded with handing them to him while stating ""Do whatever you want with them. I just think it was too much of a coincidence for you to not have them"". He looked at me quite confused, in a way that a person with absolutely no belief in supernatural things would do. He accepted the offering and stated that he hope it brings good luck, then continued to walk away with his dog.   


I started hesitating the moment I walked away from there, since I pictured him throwing them away. My hesitation mostly originated from his reaction and that he was more eager to get on with his day, than acknowledging my gesture. Although the thought would never have occurred to me if my friend hadn't proposed it, I feel that the provided information was inevitable since both him and I was planning to call each other at the exact same moment, which means that he would have gained knowledge about the situation in one way or another.  


So my questions is: What would you have done? Was it a mistake to give them to him, or do you believe that they might have been meant for him, despite his initial reaction?

My grandparents found him as a kitten in Greece when he was barely three months old. They fed and tamed him and then went back home (their residence in Greece is a holiday home). It was alright though, since we had just arrived to stay for a few weeks. At the end of our stay however, we realised that we couldn’t just leave him there since he was accustomed to humans by now. My brother and I (aged 5 and 8 back then), named him Ernie after Ernie from Sesame Street, because he was so quirky and funny, just like Ernie. We took Ernie back home with us to Germany. During the first few weeks, he lived only in my room, before we let him into the house, where we kept him for another few weeks before finally letting him outside whenever he wanted to. 

That was 13 years ago. Ernie is an old man now. Still, he is in great shape, hunts and fights with other cats. He is also still as annoying. When he hungrily shouts at us in the mornings, his voice is like a buzzsaw, cutting through the thick silence in our neighbourhood. More often than not, I am unlucky and he comes to me of all people. I live under the roof, in the top room. I don’t have a door, but a hatch I can close over the stairs leading up to my room. Ernie often sits on the top step and shouts at my hatch until I get up. I’m usually in a very bad mood when he does this, because it usually happens before 6am. I then go downstairs with him and half-heartedly throw him some snacks, give him some dry food and go back to try and get some more sleep. 

A few weeks ago, he sat on the top step and shouted at my door again. I had been out late the night before and couldn’t be asked to even go downstairs to give him anything. Instead, I just opened my hatch and went back to bed. Now, I expected him to come after me and make sure I came down with him like he used to for many years. However, instead, he jumped onto my bed and lay down on top of me, purring loudly. I fell asleep again and when I woke up around 8am, he was still sleeping on top of me, despite my family rumbling around in the kitchen downstairs (which usually prompts a sprint and numerous deafening shouts from him in order to get someone to feed him). Since then, I usually just open the hatch when he shouts at me again and he now hops onto my bed and cuddles with me every time.

I get there and I sit there acting normal then this other professor appears saying mine is not coming and she’s the one who will be taking the exam. She wants us to leave all of our stuff in the back and just sit there with our pens and calculator and in my head I knew I couldn’t do that since everyone would see the stain. So when everyone got up to leave their stuff in the back I just left. 
Now I’m 100% failing the class just as nature failed me :)&lt;/p&gt;

I have a holiday coming up late this year which includes snorkelling out at sea. I love looking at marine life, and turning this down would really sadden me in hindsight.

I finally arrived at the pool at 11:30. Hesitated as I entered. It was cold but bearable. There were no floats in view as it was just a normal lane session. This had me uneasy but luckily the slow lane was on the end so I could grab on to the side if I felt I needed to. I did 50m breast stroke and was honestly thinking 'I'm actually not bad at swimming'. I did have a small moment of panic as my breathing rhythm messed up. But after a bit spluttering I finally returned to the normal rhythm and this was without having to touch the side of the pool for support! In the end. I did 150m before my body felt super exhausted.

However, there are some things most people get wrong about this movie and I thought it would make interesting conversation to point them out. 

One of the biggest things that people get wrong about this movie is that most people will say Dorothy ran away from home because she was searching for a better world but that's not why she ran away from home. We see at the beginning of this movie Dorothy running home with Toto because Miss. Gultch tried to hurt her dog. Dorothy tries to tell her Aunt and Uncle about her problems but they don't listen to her and neither do her three friends who work on the farm that she talks to. Then Miss. Gultch stops by Dorothy's home and says that Toto must be destroyed and of course again Dorothy tries to defend her dog but to no avail, the dog is taken away. Toto then on the road jumps out of the basket and runs back home and Dorothy is glad to see her dog. Then she says ""they'll be back for you in a minute. We've got to get away, we've got to run away."" Dorothy is right, I have no doubts that Miss. Gultch would return for the dog to destroy it and why should Dorothy go to her Aunt or Uncle or the friends on the farm for help? They haven't been helpful so far so Dorothy runs away not to seek a better world in search of something she always had, she ran away to save her dog's life because no one else seemed to care about her dog at all. 

Another thing about this movie that popped out to me is the wicked witch of the west. The wicked witch visits and finds out that her sister was killed (which everyone in Munchkin Land had a parade and celebration over someone dying they put the fun in funeral.) The wicked witch goes to collect the ruby slippers but Dorothy is wearing them. The good witch tells Dorothy to stay in the slippers and not give them to the wicked witch... 

So, basically, the good witch stole the slippers from a dead person and had Dorothy wear them. The wicked witch only wants what is rightfully hers, the shoes. It doesn't matter how powerful those shoes are, they don't belong to Dorothy they belong to the wicked witch and the good witch had no right to steal them. 

Another thing, is the good witch really good? I have my doubts. We only have her word for it that only bad witches are ugly (yet she asks Dorothy several times if she is a good witch or bad witch and has the gall to ask her if she brought her broomstick which is a roundabout way of asking again if Dorothy is a good or bad witch. Ouch.) We can assume that the good witch had some sort of problem with the wicked witch of the east which is why she doesn't want the other witch to have the ruby slippers. What the problem was, we are never told in this movie. Then like I said the good witch steals the shoes from a dead person and instead of wearing the slippers and dealing with the problem herself the ""good"" witch hands the problem over to Dorothy for her to deal with. If I were Dorothy I would have told the good witch that she can wear the stinking slippers and deal with the problem herself. 

What really made me mad at the good witch is the near ending of this movie. Dorothy is in Oz and the Wizard has flown off and Dorothy thinks she can't get home when the good witch appears and tells Dorothy that she had the power to leave Oz the whole time. If I were Dorothy I would have punched that witch right then and there for that. The reason she gave for not telling Dorothy before that she could get home is that Dorothy wouldn't have believed her. The good witch never gave Dorothy a chance to believe her. Then again with the stupid lesson that Dorothy stating that her lesson was that if she was looking for her heart's desire again she didn't have to go further then her own backyard, because if it isn't there then she really never lost it, to begin with. I'm thinking to myself ""um no!"" Dorothy didn't leave home because she was looking for her heart's desire she was trying to protect her dog from being destroyed. 

So, anyway, that's my thoughts on this movie. I still think it's a wonderful movie and I really enjoy watching it. What are your thoughts on this movie?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off I love the movie The Wizard Of Oz, I&amp;#39;ve watched it over a million times and just love it every time.

Toto then on the road jumps out of the basket and runs back home and Dorothy is glad to see her dog. Then she says &amp;quot;they&amp;#39;ll be back for you in a minute. We&amp;#39;ve got to get away, we&amp;#39;ve got to run away.&amp;quot; Dorothy is right, I have no doubts that Miss. Gultch would return for the dog to destroy it and why should Dorothy go to her Aunt or Uncle or the friends on the farm for help? They haven&amp;#39;t been helpful so far so Dorothy runs away not to seek a better world in search of something she always had, she ran away to save her dog&amp;#39;s life because no one else seemed to care about her dog at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing about this movie that popped out to me is the wicked witch of the west. The wicked witch visits and finds out that her sister was killed (which everyone in Munchkin Land had a parade and celebration over someone dying they put the fun in funeral.) The wicked witch goes to collect the ruby slippers but Dorothy is wearing them. The good witch tells Dorothy to stay in the slippers and not give them to the wicked witch... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, basically, the good witch stole the slippers from a dead person and had Dorothy wear them. The wicked witch only wants what is rightfully hers, the shoes. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter how powerful those shoes are, they don&amp;#39;t belong to Dorothy they belong to the wicked witch and the good witch had no right to steal them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing, is the good witch really good? I have my doubts. We only have her word for it that only bad witches are ugly (yet she asks Dorothy several times if she is a good witch or bad witch and has the gall to ask her if she brought her broomstick which is a roundabout way of asking again if Dorothy is a good or bad witch. Ouch.) We can assume that the good witch had some sort of problem with the wicked witch of the east which is why she doesn&amp;#39;t want the other witch to have the ruby slippers. What the problem was, we are never told in this movie. Then like I said the good witch steals the shoes from a dead person and instead of wearing the slippers and dealing with the problem herself the &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; witch hands the problem over to Dorothy for her to deal with. If I were Dorothy I would have told the good witch that she can wear the stinking slippers and deal with the problem herself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What really made me mad at the good witch is the near ending of this movie. Dorothy is in Oz and the Wizard has flown off and Dorothy thinks she can&amp;#39;t get home when the good witch appears and tells Dorothy that she had the power to leave Oz the whole time. If I were Dorothy I would have punched that witch right then and there for that. The reason she gave for not telling Dorothy before that she could get home is that Dorothy wouldn&amp;#39;t have believed her. The good witch never gave Dorothy a chance to believe her. Then again with the stupid lesson that Dorothy stating that her lesson was that if she was looking for her heart&amp;#39;s desire again she didn&amp;#39;t have to go further then her own backyard, because if it isn&amp;#39;t there then she really never lost it, to begin with. I&amp;#39;m thinking to myself &amp;quot;um no!&amp;quot; Dorothy didn&amp;#39;t leave home because she was looking for her heart&amp;#39;s desire she was trying to protect her dog from being destroyed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, anyway, that&amp;#39;s my thoughts on this movie. I still think it&amp;#39;s a wonderful movie and I really enjoy watching it. What are your thoughts on this movie?&lt;/p&gt;

My parents (especially my dad) pushed me towards a retail job because they have this negative stigma towards working fast food which was my job before, from ages 16-17 (Mcdonalds.) They have the typical negative stigma like fast food workers are usually lazy and HS dropouts, going no where with life etc. I recently started applying for fast food jobs again because I realize how this retail job is just draining and i hate it. I have an interview today at a McDonald’s (hopefully it goes well I’m writing this as I sit here and wait on my interviewer!!) I am so excited but they seem so disappointed I am quitting my current retail job because I will be making less per hour but I will have the opportunity to work WAYYYYYYY more hours at McDonald’s considering it’s a 24/7 location. I love the interaction I get with people working fast food versus working retail. I see so many people all day and when I worked at McDonald’s in the past I loved all my coworkers because they came from SOOOO many backgrounds &amp;amp;  various ages. I am still Facebook friends with every single person I met at McDonald’s when I was 16 and they’re all still wonderful. The environment at my retail job is lowkey toxic and there are cliques and I feel as no one likes me either so no one ever covers my shifts when I ask but I’ve covered everyone’s that’s ever asked me it’s whatever though. I don’t know what I’m exactly asking for... maybe validation that this choice is ok? but, has anyone else preferred working fast food rather than retail?? Or am I a total weirdo lol. It makes me anxious that my parents are so against my decision.&lt;/p&gt;

At my last job, some of my coworkers would all flock to the ""cool"" coworkers while trying to avoid the ""uncool"" coworkers like myself. For example, if a manager said to a coworker to go help out at the mail table and me and another ""uncool"" coworker were at the mail table, the coworker would complain to the manager about having to work with us. Dude literally said ""I don't like them."" The issue with me is that I'm fully aware that my former coworkers were jerks and tried too hard to impress management both in a ""I'm good at my job"" way and a ""Let's hang out outside of work"" type of way but I'm upset that people looked at me like ""who cares about her"" type of way and ""she doesn't count as a team member"" type of way. Because it literally made me feel like I didn't count as a person. I came home everyday feeling like crap with a strong desire of wanting to die. Everyone at my former job was grown yet it felt like high school all over again. It's like I'll always be an outcast. But the question is how do I become okay with being an outcast. Yesterday, I was called into the break room by my managers and the human resource manager to discuss my recurring performance issues. I felt like they didn't want me there anymore so I quit. But you know what I'm thinking about now? I've worked there longer than most people last. I worked there for a whole 9 months. And people at my job like to bring up former coworkers and laugh about them. I already know that my former manager who started three weeks before i did, who everyone flocks to is going to be like ""She sucked and she smelled really bad. Horrible breath. She was so dumb. Like sorry but...damn. And she had the ugliest face I've ever seen. Boogers all in her nose. Acne all over her face. It's like...do you shower?"" He's going to say something like that and everyone is going to agree. But why do I care anymore if I'm not working there? How do I stop caring so much? I only don't care what people think when I'm really depressed and pissed at the same time.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I realize that I hold people&amp;#39;s opinions on a pedestal yet I despise people for doing the same.

&amp;#x200B;

Specifically, here's what's going on. I'm 17, will be a senior this fall. I've been big into acting for high school, but as of this year I've become burnt out. I did four shows this year. I've grown tired of acting, and I don't think it's for me. At least, I don't enjoy it anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I've found that I really enjoy writing scripts, whether they be play scripts or screenplays. So I was going to take this summer to relax (for once) and write. And in college, I would like to focus on my two passions: singing and writing. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, the summer show at my favorite local theatre company is starting in a few days, and I kind of want to go back on my commitment to ""retire from acting"" and join. 

  
However, I'm nervous and i know I shouldn't because I don't think I'll enjoy it. I never did enjoy it I think. I'm introverted, and I don't get along with the average person very well. I don't like being bossed around by directors either, and I don't like being thought of as dumber or not as creative as I am. I don't want to sound arrogant, but this is how I honestly feel. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I just don't enjoy acting anymore. So, I know I wouldn't enjoy the show if I did it... BUT, I'm afraid I'm missing something. What if this is the show where I fall in love with acting again? I know I won't enjoy it and it won't be super special.

(( Sorry for terrible english in advance)) ....

First of all , i was born and raised in what considered a 3rd world country but not so much to me since i’m a bit biest to it, I enjoyed my childhood and my teenage years even though it was kinda strict where i lived, let’s just say it’s in the Middle East.


i’ve always found my self leaning toward the american culture, the memes ,youtube channels , tv shows and everything, So when i found out that i can get this full-ride bachelor program + 1 language school year scholarship to the U.S Plus monthly allowance,  i studied hard in order to apply and spend the next 5 years after high school in what i considered the best place on earth. 



So i worked hard and got the scholarship eventually, And i just arrived to CA 3 days ago to start my language school year before applying to college, The moment i stepped outside the airport and felt the fresh air made me smile right away, The weather the streets and everything was just above and beyond what i’m used to and i’m still to this moment so amazed and happy.


i got a new friend in the process (from the same country) that arrived before me , So he hooked me up with a family housing AND payed the safety deposit of 200$ it wasn’t much but just doing that for someone you barley know is something, I got here and signed the contract and everything the old lady i’m staying with is so kind and helpful, i met the guy for the first time and i can tell he was thrilled to find someone that he can relate to and talk to, We got along so fast and hang out for the past two days and had alot of fun.

{{{{{ Now to the main part i made this post, if anyone is reading to this part anyways haha}}}}}

We were looking for an upgrade from the hosing options we’re at right now, Because no matter how nice the family is you can’t just chill in the living room and feel comfortable like it’s your home. ( We need a place for our own:we agreed)

So we looked into the very  nice apartment complexes near the school (since we don’t have a car) that has gym and pools , Patios in every apartment and it would look like more of a resort than just a flat, However the only plan we can afford is this spacious 1 bdr 1 bath of 826 sqft.

We were so amazed by the complex and the amenities that we didn’t care about sharing a bath and making half of the living room as a second bedroom since it’s spacious enough.



My question is am i rushing this ? in the end we need to sign a 6 month lease to get the price we want , And we cant break the lease after a month or two, Like i know we can’t get a better deal than this and its so close to the school and the guy seems nice and all but the thought of 6 month lease scares me.

What if 1 bath gets annoying after time or or or or , please if you have anything to share from an experience or something let me know!

I played sports as a kid, and it was always the part I disliked the most. Doctors told my I had “sports asthma” so even when I was young and thin, my lungs never dealt with running very well.

I tried time and time again throughout my 20’s to get into running.  It would go ok the first few times, but then I’d have some sort of severe lower body soreness or pain that would make me stop for a week plus, and basically ruin my progress.

I turned 31 this year, heavier than I wanted to be, and just generally feeling like I had let myself go. I started last year with a lot of walking, and this year I vowed to get back into running somehow. I was dreading it, but I made a promise to myself, and I planned to keep it.

I started really slow, as in, felt comically slow when I started 2 months ago. So slow that it barely felt like jogging. I felt like I looked stupid, but didn’t care, I was going to get better at this. I was really aware of my form, assuming that could be part of my previous issue with pain. My goal was to go a mile straight without stopping, and ran as slow as I needed to accomplish this. 

To my surprise after 2 weeks, I had no severe pain in my lower body, and each “run” was getting easier than the last. I did a mile from the beginning with no stopping, I started around a 14 minute pace. Two months in I’m under 11 minutes but getting better every run. I’m not terribly sore, and I just feel so much better. My resting heart rate has decreased, which has inspired me to be more active even on the days I’m not running. 

This is the longest I’ve ever kept a consistent running habit, and I’m hoping to keep it going. I think I finally understand what all the fuss is about.

TLDR: If you can’t seem to get into running, sometimes it helps to really focus on form, not speed, and just build your way up. I’ve never been able to make a habit of running, and so far this has been keeping me going.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of my life, I’ve hated running.

I did a mile from the beginning with no stopping, I started around a 14 minute pace. Two months in I’m under 11 minutes but getting better every run. I’m not terribly sore, and I just feel so much better. My resting heart rate has decreased, which has inspired me to be more active even on the days I’m not running. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the longest I’ve ever kept a consistent running habit, and I’m hoping to keep it going. I think I finally understand what all the fuss is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: If you can’t seem to get into running, sometimes it helps to really focus on form, not speed, and just build your way up. I’ve never been able to make a habit of running, and so far this has been keeping me going.&lt;/p&gt;

In this class, we learn music theory and how to play the piano, except the school can't afford a bunch of pianos, so we have keyboards instead.

I was super excited for this course. I love music. I've been taking lessons for 7 years now. The year I took keyboard was my 6th.

6th grade was the first year of middle school. When I went on ""fifth-grade orientation"" to tour the place, we went to keyboard and I asked the teacher there if it was a beginner class. She said no.

She lied to me. But I couldn't explain my feelings of fury, because she retired the next year, so I never had her. Instead, I had Mr. C.

He was the most fun teacher I've ever had. He really understood middle schoolers. We played kahoot, we did a beanbag throwing game to learn the notes of the staff.

But I couldn't grasp that when I was there. I was bitter the whole year because I was stuck in a beginner class when I had learned all of the stuff he taught in 1st grade. He gave me more challenging pieces than the rest to work on while we were working on songs, but I still had to sit through classes about the notes of the staff and the note values and other boring stuff that I knew since forever.

Also, this kid in my class named Caiden kept making fun of me because I was a ""teacher's pet."" It's not my fault I'm better than you, I'd say if this happened now. But I couldn't take it back then.

So because the class was too easy and Caiden was being himself, I transferred to Chorus for 7th grade. But I hate it so much. The class is boring AF. All we do is sing the same shitty songs over and over again. And 4 kids in my class were making fun of me FOR SINGING IN CHORUS CLASS. For a huge part of the year, I regretted even coming.

My friends Sana and Niko, who were both in my class last year, both fill me in on what's happening without me. My friend Holly is in 6th grade and she is also musically inclined, she takes voice lessons at the same place where I take piano. But she's not leaving, so she gets what I don't.

Last Thursday, 6/6, I went to the bathroom in the middle of chorus to get away from it. I had just finished my chorus final, on the same stuff I learned in Keyboard last year and in piano lessons in 1st grade, and I had a bit of a headache, so I yeeted outta there. In the bathroom, I see 4 out of the 6 girls there. They tell me that Mr. C is going to teach 6th-grade band next year.

This week is the last day of school. I realize how good of a teacher Mr. C really was. He didn't have to try to challenge me. He really didn't. But he tried anyway. He was the best teacher I've ever had, the only one that really cared about me.

So I decide, ""I'm going to make him a card, and get all of his students to sign it.""

Niko agreed to get his class to sign it right away, P5.

Sana took a little more influencing, but she agreed to do P4.

I tried to get Holly, who was P7, to pass it down to P6 since the 2 periods were back to back. (7 comes before 6 since we have flip days at school where it's 1 2 3 7 6 5 4 on Tuesdays and Thursdays). But she refused. So I told her to just get her class, but to meet me in the stairwell before her lunch period (I have a math class downstairs my P7, her lunch period).

The 8th-grade classes don't participate because they have graduation

But she never shows up. I have to go to math. But then I tell my teacher I'm going to the bathroom at the end of the 6th grade lunch period, and I go there instead. I find Holly and tell her to do her class, and I tell her that I'll find her after my lunch period since that's when her class ends.

Her class signs it. I fist-pump. I ask her if there's a P6 keyboard class today, but they had PE. I thought I was doomed. I wouldn't be able to get that class.

But then I see my friend Josh in 6th grade, who I met in art club, to get all the keyboard people in his keyboard class to sign it. He agrees to do it. I go to Spanish, which is upstairs.

Niko and I have Spanish together, and at the end of the period, we run down to PE to find that kid. He gives us the card back, and I give it to Niko to get his class to sign it. From there it's all smooth sailing. I go to art on the other side of the building. Then I come for Chorus and Sana for Keyboard. Niko and I make the exchange, I sign it, and give it to Sana. She does the final period.

Then we give it to Mr. Cyr. He hugs me and Sana since we present it to him. I can't believe we succeeded. It took so much work, but we succeeded.

I'm at home right now. I think to myself that if I had him this year, I wouldn't have done this for him. I would still be bitter. Because of chorus, I learned that ""you only know someone when you let them go.""

And now I feel happy with myself. I've changed a lot since the day I walked into his class for the first time, but that's okay. I'm fine with that. I'm happy for the first time since Chorus.

&lt;p&gt;Should I go to a tailor, or a department store?&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, the sun itself is giving you a big middle finger for at least a few more hours. 

After rolling out of bed, jumping in the car, waiting in what seems to be an endless line of cars full of other soldiers at the Post gate to prove that you aren't; in fact, a terrorist, you finally get to the area where you meet up with the rest of your unit for morning formation and physical training.

You're 45 minutes earlier than you really need to be because your squad leader demands that you arrive 15 minutes before the time that your platoon sergeant demands that you arrive, which is 30 minutes prior to when your First Sergeant requires you to actually be there. All of that, just to stand around for another 10 to 15 minutes while the leadership discusses, plans, and then re-discusses every single detail of everything that will happen throughout the entire day. 

Then, you stand in formation. It is either already blistering hot, or so cold that you fear the loss of certain parts of your anatomy. Then, there's the painfully formal process of reporting to the First Sergeant and Commander everything that they already know from the morning meeting that you were not a part of, yet had to be present for.  You think you're getting ready for a six mile formation run. You silently ponder the murder of the person that will be behind you, because he can't stay in freaking step and will almost certainly step on the back of your shoes at least once per quarter mile.

This frustration is encountered nearly every...single...morning. Then, it happens... Whomever is leading the morning's P.T. regiment yells out the one word that every soldier prays to hear. This one, beautiful word can literally restore your faith in humanity. You never know when it's coming, which makes it all the sweeter.

Suddenly, its like roaches with the lights on! Everything you were ever taught about ""leave no man behind"" goes right out the window. It's every soldier for him or herself. Everyone scatters.  Barracks soldiers trample each other as they all try to rush into the building at once.  Off Post dwellers make a mad dash for their car and just pray they can get out of the parking lot before leadership decides they need a NCO for some random detail.

If you make it, the day is yours to do whatever you will with it.  The sun shines brighter, the air smells sweeter.  I can think of no better way to improve upon morale than with the occasional implementation of the zonk.

I asked what the cord signified, and she told me it means &amp;quot;straight As for all 7th and 8th grade.&amp;quot; Wow, okay. Then I found out he was voted &amp;quot;Nicest&amp;quot; by his 8th grade class (of about 400 students). Who gets voted &amp;quot;Nicest&amp;quot;?! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sister is my best friend, and I love her kids so much. He&amp;#39;s such a quiet and unassuming, easygoing, friendly kid. Sorry if it seems like I&amp;#39;m bragging but I can&amp;#39;t stop thinking about how proud I am of him. I can&amp;#39;t wait to go to his graduation and cheer him on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone else have graduations coming up? And how much is normal to give a kid as a graduation gift these days?&lt;/p&gt;

How he can do this or that.  how someone tells him wow he can do such and such and he did it all by himself.  

I've been in his shoes, not as extreme though.  So I think I kind of understand what he is going through.

There is usually a silence after or someone indulges this person.  Like oh is that so, wow, thats amazing and such.  But I feel like this just fuels it even more.

We also got to the topic of this person's family.  They all have successful prestigious jobs, while he works in retail.  He usually says how he is different than the others.

Part of me wants to really call it out.  Like I see, so it seems being smart seems to be really important to you, seeing as you come from a family full of prestigious careers, there must be lot of pressure to do so.  After growing up in an environment your whole life where being intelligent is what makes you proudly praised and accepted, it seems you put most of your self identity as someone who has to be smart.  Yet you identify as being different than everyone else.  I feel like while everyone is unique and you may certainly have different interests and personalities compared to your family, part of it I think is kind of a defensive way of thinking.  Anytime you can't do something intelligent according to your family, it would just be because you are unique and misunderstood.  To accept that maybe you don't got it in you to be a doctor or be someone who's ""made it"" is like being rejected and being stupid, which i feel like you put so much of your self worth in.  You don't need to prove to us you are smart or unique.  

Or something like that.  I feel it's not my place to say so.  It's not like I know his life, I'm just guessing from what I seen.  Think blowing up on him wouldn't do any good.  Yet it kind of is annoying to hear it too.  It comes up almost every time we meet.

We had a few days in Amsterdam; the stay was wonderful. One unexpected afternoon, we saw a white cat sitting at the steps of this storefront which sold hallucinogenic truffles so we took it as a good omen and went inside. We spoke to the lady there and she handed us a menu of the stuff they sold there. We both have had some prior experiences tripping, but we didn’t want to go balls deep into tripping in Amsterdam so we settled for some mild truffles which, accordingly to our guide, were supposed to give us some giggles and very slight visuals. We paid the fair lady, and walked out. Slowly chewing on the truffles, we ventured towards Vondelpark. 

It was on the light rail to Vondelpark that I realized I had to put on my sunglasses due to the melting nature of my surroundings. At some point I realized I was grinning like a creep, for god knows how long at this point. It dawned on me that we were totally unprepared for what was about to happen to us. It hit me first, though my gf was already spacing out herself. The train was full and we sat across from each other, occasionally peering at each other in attempt to comprehend each other’s level of fucked up-ness. It was difficult to focus on the stops, but I managed to pay enough attention to know when to get off. When we got to Vondelpark, we finally acknowledged the situation, and giggled about it. Though, my giggles were halfhearted. You see, in the past I had a really bad trip on LSD, with which I still haven’t entirely reconciled, and there was a small part of me beginning to panic, thought I couldn’t reveal this to my girlfriend as I felt it would ruin her experience, and freak us out entirely. Being in a foreign country, THOUSANDS of miles away from the comfort of our own little home in Chicago was the heaviest dose of reality that first seeped into my mind, it was a terrifying thought. 

I maintained my composure though, and took in the sights, and the vastness of the big beautiful park. We walked hand in hand, listening to the birds, the joggers, the rustling of the trees in the gentle breeze of this late spring afternoon. It was a good distraction, and the best distraction came next. I was living a dual experience, absolutely adoring the beauty of this park, this country and this experience, all the while deep inside, my conscience was finding all the possible safety nets I can harness in case this situation goes totally south. And that’s when the latter half of my conscience vanished…we turned a corner of this walkway and stood at the entrance to a field. To my right were little round shrubs bobbing up and down and side to side, seemingly emitting a cute little sound, scattered throughout with tiny walkways separating them. And on one of these tiny walkways stood a couple, with sunglasses on, giant grins, pointing at a perfectly innocent shrub, giggling. We were not alone. 

It was a Wednesday, and we weren’t alone in this park tripping our balls off. We walked a little further and saw a small group of people having the time of their lives, I couldn’t tell if they were tripping, or doing something else or maybe nothing at all, it didn’t matter. It suddenly dawned on me that Amsterdam is friendly place, and while I was coming to this realization, Amsterdam itself took on a personality, character, being and form. The town became our friend, our guide, our mentor, showing us the splendor of all the good that it had to offer. The town took us under its’ wing. We must have walked around for hours, through the park into beautiful neighborhoods. I tried to navigate google maps but to no avail, and with the setting sun, all I knew is that we had to walk west. And eventually we reached our little temporary home; I’ve always had a good internal compass, a good sense for direction. At this point, the experience took on balance, and downshifted to a manageable gear. It was truly wonderful. We reflected on the last several hours in bed with gratitude, and laughter until we fell asleep.

In retrospect, I think everything we've learned about Amsterdam the few days prior left a very good impression on us. So much so that when we were in the grips of a hallucinogenic experience in an unfamiliar place, we took everything we knew about the town and brought it to life through the power of our subconscious, which inevitably guided us through the rest of our wonderful Journey.

&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently begun thinking things like “wait why is the old west seen a setting for exploring vengeance”, and “why is the theme of vengeance worth discussing” and “why do I innately FEEL something for stories that discuss vengeance”. I haven’t come up with any truly satisfying answers past “there isn’t really a reason” (which feels wrong given people DO end up exploring things for more than just random chance) or “well it has some links to how real life is”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone get the thought train I’m on/has been on it themselves? What answers do you think I could arrive at?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean she has emotionally titanium-walled me, and completely ignored me from everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;maybe its my fault, maybe its hers too.  And I feel soooo much like Steve&amp;#39;s character in the bar. Because I am trying to share it to the internet, have posted it on &lt;a href=""/r/advice""&gt;r/advice&lt;/a&gt;(read it if you have the mood. Its really fucking long. But I poured my heart in it). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I talked about this to 3 of my friends. Can&amp;#39;t talk to anyone from the college because everyone is somehow closer to the bestie, the guy who is (kind of) replacing me, and the guy who is trying to woo her in a creepy way(he&amp;#39;s kind of a creep, with a somewhat similar origin story like Batman&amp;#39;s but he&amp;#39;s really really helpful. And he was going through what I have been going through now). Feel really alone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am so tired of this bullshit because there seems to be no end in sight that&amp;#39;s good for everyone and there is no closure because I have so many doubts and reasons to ask. feels like I am going crazy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;need someone like ryan gosling. and steves future sexy suave self to come to me&lt;/p&gt;

I am a painter and decorator and I was called to renovate a new flat that is up for rent on a council apartment complex (or a block of flats as they are called in the UK). I've never been in the buildings before then, however, I've known the area for years and for the past few, it's gotten worse in terms of looks and crime. It's a bit of a shit-hole, actually, to put it bluntly. It's a very dull place that isn't well looked after.

So, my work was to be carried out on one of the highest floors, and normally, I would take the stairs but this time, I had to take the elevator as I had bags and other things with me I didn't want to struggle carrying up several flights of stairs.

As I trudged towards the elevator, a guy came out of it and warned me that there were two junkies sitting inside that were high on heroin and had appeared to have passed out. I didn't really acknowledge it since it didn't surprise me, I wasn't scared of getting mugged or anything (considering I had nothing of value on me anyway besides my work phone). 

I got in and a man and a woman were sort of slouched in the corner. I didn't see needles but they were definitely junkies, a sad sight to see. I sort of stood there hoping the elevator would hurry up and get to my floor so I can leave. I was feeling very uncomfortable being in a tight space with these two people.

But halfway there, I noticed that something just didn't look right about them. They weren't moving an inch, and they didn't appear to be breathing. So I bent down and gazed at the young woman. Her face was just lifeless. I used my foot to nudge them both to get their attention. Nothing.

I knew from that instant. I had to call the police first about them, then my boss to say that I had to delay my work as I found two bodies on the way. They arrived within ten minutes, their bodies were taken away and I had to start my work much later than usual.

It was really sad and sickening to see that shit. They were definitely in their twenties - probably my age or only slightly older - and were most likely a couple that just happened to overdose at the same time and place. It's the first time I've seen dead bodies in the twenty-three-years I've been living as well.

So, all in all, today has been crazy. Two sets of parents are going to receive some awful news.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I got back from the police station a few hours ago after having to give statements because I found two dead bodies while I was at work and I still feel sick and shaken up about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a painter and decorator and I was called to renovate a new flat that is up for rent on a council apartment complex (or a block of flats as they are called in the UK). I&amp;#39;ve never been in the buildings before then, however, I&amp;#39;ve known the area for years and for the past few, it&amp;#39;s gotten worse in terms of looks and crime. It&amp;#39;s a bit of a shit-hole, actually, to put it bluntly. It&amp;#39;s a very dull place that isn&amp;#39;t well looked after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my work was to be carried out on one of the highest floors, and normally, I would take the stairs but this time, I had to take the elevator as I had bags and other things with me I didn&amp;#39;t want to struggle carrying up several flights of stairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I trudged towards the elevator, a guy came out of it and warned me that there were two junkies sitting inside that were high on heroin and had appeared to have passed out. I didn&amp;#39;t really acknowledge it since it didn&amp;#39;t surprise me, I wasn&amp;#39;t scared of getting mugged or anything (considering I had nothing of value on me anyway besides my work phone). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got in and a man and a woman were sort of slouched in the corner. I didn&amp;#39;t see needles but they were definitely junkies, a sad sight to see. I sort of stood there hoping the elevator would hurry up and get to my floor so I can leave. I was feeling very uncomfortable being in a tight space with these two people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But halfway there, I noticed that something just didn&amp;#39;t look right about them. They weren&amp;#39;t moving an inch, and they didn&amp;#39;t appear to be breathing. So I bent down and gazed at the young woman. Her face was just lifeless. I used my foot to nudge them both to get their attention. Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

This morning when I was walking to my car to go to work (after waking up a bit late from smoking the previous night... Whoops) I decided to grab some Starbucks since it was on the way to my job. So I did what anyone would do; I pulled out my phone, ordered my drink and breakfast sandwich, and went on my way to pick it up from the shop. It was then that the realization dawned of me that I am very much living in the future. Everyday without thinking I pull out this tablet device connected to fucking satellites floating in space that can do pretty much anything I imagine. From playing games, to watching videos, to ordering food &amp; drinks and having them come to my door! All of this just by literally pressing a button, no need for a phone call or even really human interaction. We have begun to shift to electronic vehicles and have started the (VERY SLOW) process of shifting away from oil and coal. If I have a question about literally anything I have a search engine (Google) at my fingertips that contains literally millions of entries based upon things that are related to what I'm looking for.

&amp;#x200B;

Although there is a lot to improve on obviously, I felt very much that I am living in a time where things are becoming incredibly advanced and continue to do so every day. It just blows my mind that even if I'm too lazy to grab my phone I can literally just call out ""Hey Siri"" and it will respond to me waiting for a command. The same thing goes for Alexa who can set schedules, order things, and even turn on/off lights and other electronics, all with a voice command. We have people who lost their limbs and we've created FUCKING ROBOT ARMS AND LEGS because we fucking can and that's awesome. I'm probably still a little bit high to be honest, but this shit if just mind blowing to me. I'm very excited to see what more the future can hold in 10, 20, and 50 years or more.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this is probably redundant and small to a lot of people, but I just realized how much we as people take technology for granted. One example of this is obesity. Obviously it is bad and unhealthy, but the fact that food and nourishment is SO EASY to come by that some people struggle to lose weight is a testament to just how lucky we are. Gone are the days of hunting and foraging for most and now are the times were we have AIs waiting to do our every command. The knowledge of the world very much at our fingertips and an abundance of options to make our everyday lives easier. Just 100 years ago people were just shifting away from horses to cars for transportation and now it is absurd to even entertain the idea of using an animal as a means of conventional travel (though exceptions and outliers to this obviously apply).

But I did it! My lessons instructor luckily taught me how to park in the last 20 minutes before the test and although I honestly wasn’t comfortable at all in parking my car, I was able to complete the parking at the end of the test. 

When I first started the engine, I had forgotten to turn off my emergency button because my driving test instructor was checking all of the buttons to see if they were working, and I just totally forgot about it until I realized the car wasn’t giving any left or right turn signals. Luckily I noticed immediately after I started my turn so my test instructor overlooked it.

I also forgot to check my side mirrors and see if I had to readjust when I first started the drivings test. I was lucky that I was able to explain to my driving test instructor and he understandably understood why and for the emergency button as well.

As you can see my test started out atrociously, but I kept my cool and continued driving because I knew some minor mistakes wouldn’t prevent me from getting my license.

Once we started getting into the real road action, the instructor asked me some personal questions, such as where did you goto highschool, and where are you attending. I told my instructor how I went to this small-medium sized highschool in my city and coincidentally his son currently attends there as well. We talked about his son, about college, about our future goals, about what I would do if I had gotten my license(because I lived far away from my highschool).

That lasted from 15-20 minutes but it felt like it went by in a breeze. I passed the exam with 5 minor mistakes(mainly for being over the limit line on a single red light stop), but other than that the test went smoothly.

If anyone have any questions regarding the drivings test or just anything in general feel free to ask.

I’m not all that old since I’m 18 years of age but I believe making a casual talk with your instructor would greatly benefit you during your driving test because it helps you relieve your nerves and the driving test instructor might be more lenient.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day before of my driving’s test, I had a massive headache from all of the stress my lessons instructor was giving me because my driving test was today (talking from a yesterday’s perspective) and yesterday I still hadn’t learned how to park my vehicle and still hadn’t test drove into the dmv parking lot yet.&lt;/p&gt;
