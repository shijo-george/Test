The present era in men's tennis (let's define that as starting in 2004 when Federer became world #1 for the first time) features the three greatest players ever to play the game competing against each other and driving each other on to ever-higher levels.

They have won an incredible 53 Slams between them, no doubt with more to come. They stand at 1, 2, and 3 in the record books in terms of Slam titles. The three-way rivalry is also marked by incredible longevity. Federer has played Nadal 39 times and Djokovic 47 times. Djokovic has played Nadal 54 times, an Open Era record.

That's 140 matches just between the 3 of them. And those 140 matches have included not just one or two but many of the best matches/performances of all time. In terms of all-time great matches, you've got :

\- **Federer vs Nadal**: Wimbledon 2007 and 2008 finals, 2009 Aussie final

\- **Federer vs Djokovic**: US 2010 &amp; 2011 semi-finals

\- **Nadal vs Djokovic**: Aussie final 2012, French semi-final 2013, Wimbledon semi-final 2018

And in terms of all-time great individual performances against each other:

\- **Nadal**: French 2008 final vs Federer

\- **Federer**: French 2011 semi vs a seemingly-unbeatable Djokovic

\- **Djokovic**: US final 2011, Aussie final 2019, both vs Nadal

There are many athletes who become permanently injured because of bad form. This isn't to say that athletes with good form don't get injured. What is being pointed out is that the risk of injury increases with bad form, and learning good form is the way to reduce this risk. Every moral agent is obligated to reduce the risk as much as possible when teaching students dangerous exercises.  


The clean and jerk or snatch both require full body mobility and strength in order to execute the movements with good form. This means hitting squats at full depth without spinal curvature, learning the proper rack position, learning how to properly rotate your shoulders, etc. These concepts require significant amounts of conditioning throughout the entire kinetic chain, which is why many Olympic coaches spend a disproportionate amount of time in strength/mobility training before allowing their students to add more weights onto their primary lifts.  


This post isn't meant to bash Crossfit, but to point out what is morally right for them to do. Crossfit is a large organization which certifies trainers. This tells prospective students that certified trainers have the authority to properly teach the foundations of Crossfit (with the clean and jerk or snatch being part of it). As a casual weightlifter, I attended a Crossfit seminar recently to try to improve my own technique. There aren't many Olympic coaches where I live, and I wanted to get some personal feedback rather than exclusively watch videos made by Klokov or Torokhty. I noticed that this particular certified coach gave ""all clears"" to students who had spinal curvature in their overhead squats, hip thrusted their second pulls, and allowed their elbows to angle downward during the rack position. These extremely dangerous flaws that will cause bodily damage if they continue to execute these movements over time with high loads.

  
The other side of this position is that Crossfit isn't meant to be an Olympic weightlifting sport - it is meant to train inexperienced students to become as fit as possible in the shortest amount of time. There are other movements that Crossfit teaches \[mostly calisthenic\] that improve the athlete's fitness beyond that of a normal person. The feats accomplished by Crossfit athletes are the reason why Crossfit is even popular in the first place. With obesity being an epidemic in the United States, Crossfit has become palatable to the average person who would probably not be incentived to be conscious about their health.   


If Crossfit coaches were all required to focus more on conditioning (which takes a long time), people may be discouraged to participate in the first place. Yet, I still feel that Crossfit should be obligated to teach the Olympic lifts with proper form, even if it discourages prospective students. I am unsure that my view is correct, as I do not comprehend what is the greatest good in this scenario. I can see the overall benefit of Crossfit to the health of the citizens, but cannot get over the simple fact that it also increases their chances of injury. So change my view.

Early on, I was for the idea of making flag burning (in the United States) illegal. My opinion was based on the fact that it shouldn't be allowed because if you don't like America, then don't live here and don't visit. (I realize that there are other reasons people burn the flag, but I think this is one of the typical attitudes of people doing it: to show a dislike of the country and/or its current government.)

I still have that mentality, for the most part, but I have since more so disagreed with making flag burning illegal.

Ultimately, I see it as something that is covered under the 1st Amendment, and while I heavily disagree with someone burning the American flag, I would never do it myself, and I think they're an idiot for being so unpatriotic and sometimes ironic, at the end of the day, I believe it is their freedom and right granted to them by our nation's Constitution to express themselves in this manner. Just as it's perfectly legal to speak out against the President, Supreme Court Justices, or any other member of the government or the government itself, so is flag burning, in my opinion.

The 1st Amendment is just one of many reasons I'm proud to live in this country and expressing our dislike or disfavor is one way of expressing that right and sometimes that expression is done in more ways than just with words.

The only way I'd say it should be illegal is when it becomes more than flag burning, such as if they then use the burning flag to set a house or another person on fire. But at that point, it's no longer flag burning that would lead to them being arrested and charged with a crime but something like arson or attempted murder. The other way would be if someone was doing it on private property and the owner of the private property didn't want it, then they should not be allowed to do it there either.

So I'd like to get some feedback from others why I should change my mind.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an odd position for me as I&amp;#39;ve changed over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

If you're a DJ and just know how to do your stuff in a desk you're not a musician, mixing songs is not being a musician, applying different filters, altering waveforms, speeding songs up and down, raising and lowering the pitch. None of these things make you a musician and calling yourself one is insulting every other real musician, you're just making noise with your computer. However, with that said, you can be a DJ and musician. If you create your own tracks and later alter them with your preferred software and alter them you can be considered a musician. On the other side, if you apply so many artificial elements and turn your creation into some EDM bullshit it loses all of its musical properties, because you can be the greatest pianist in the world and play the Turkish March or flight of the bumblebee excellently and as fast as humanly possible, but if you play it on a keyboard, synth or digital piano that on each key it is programmed to play noises like a gunshot, a car door slamming, an open faucet, a frying pan burning loudly, a stomp, etc. That is not music at all.

Exhibit B: Mohammad Mosadegh and the Republic of Iran. Back in the 50's, Iran had a peaceful, liberal republic. They had a monarch, the Shah, but power was gradually transitioning towards parliament. Prime Minister Mosadegh was a progressive reformer who had the idea the government should draw on natural resources for funding - and idea that's been endorsed by many economists including Adam Smith and Milton Friedman. But when he placed a tax on oil, the company now called BP refused to pay, and the government responded by seizing their assets. The CIA responded by launching a coup (covering up their involvement for decades), overthrowing parliament and granting power to the Shah, who kept the oil flowing. The Shah was very authoritarian, sending secret police to hunt down political dissidents, and forcing the country to adopt Western customs - the police would even rip burkas off of women in public. Eventually, public discontent mounted to the point of revolution, and (with the leftists elements suppressed by secret police), religious extremists were able to take power.

Had the CIA simply not done anything, it's easily possible that the Republic of Iran would still exist today (rather than the Islamic Republic of Iran), and it could've easily been a US **ally.** Imagine a world where Iran had worked alongside the US in the War on Terror, offering their insight into local customs and so forth. They could've been a force for peace and stability in the region, but instead the CIA launched a coup and now they shout, ""Death to America!""

Once again, we see that the CIA used morally wrong methods (overthrowing a peaceful republic), and in doing so produced disastrous results. Iran is by no means the only example of this. But I find this example to be particularly inexcusable. Mosadegh was not a Communist and had zero ties whatsoever to the Soviet Union. And the coup didn't just screw over the people of Iran - it screwed over Americans too.

Buying food from any chain that exclusively sources factory farmed meat, should be considered unethical to any vegan.

I have visited many local farms that treat their animals with respect, and have beautiful pastures for them to roam. The cows eat fresh grass all day, and the pigs are fed whole vegetables grown on site. This is a stark contrast to the horrible conditions of animals raised on factory farms. Buying meat from these small farms, does more to support the ethical treatment of animals, than buying a salad from McDonald’s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying food from any chain that exclusively sources factory farmed meat, should be considered unethical to any vegan. It’s likely that their non meat choices will contribute more profit to these chains because of lower food cost. You vote with your wallet, and eating at Taco Bell is a vote for animal cruelty and unsustainable farming practice.&lt;/p&gt;

I am a strong believer in the importance of freedom of speech, and I'm loath to suggest someone should be punished for their beliefs or comments, PARTICULARLY for beliefs or comments made in a religious setting. That is, indeed, why I'm asking here, because I am very rarely of the view that something shouldn't be protected. I will usually, in fact, argue that a person who is privately employed shouldn't be fired for out-of-work stuff, even if it's horrible, but this is in fact a state matter, and thus Pastor/Detective Fritts should (and does) enjoy a strong first amendment protection for his statements made as a private citizen (or here as a preacher.)

However, I also do understand, and support, some of the exceptions that have been placed by the courts on freedom of speech. In this particular case, I'm referring to an exception that a government employee can be punished for behavior they engage in not as an official representative of the state, if that behavior and/or the statements they make can have a negative effect on their ability to do their job.

I want to be clear on what I want my view changed on. I have no interest in discussing whether or not the state can execute people for homosexuality or homosexual behavior. It cannot. Nor do I want to debate the MORALITY of homosexual behavior. My fiancee and I have already made wedding plans, and I don't want to anger the venue by backing out. And as far as the morality goes, quite frankly, had Pastor/Detective Fritts said he wished that the state COULD execute people for homosexuality, I wouldn't be here. He can wish the laws to be whatever he would like.  However, he made the statement that it does, that what goes on at a pride event would be something that people can be executed for.

A firing is, or can be, a retaliatory act. The government can and should be prevented from punishing someone for protected speech. As I understand it, to determine if a certain act of speech is protected, there's a three part test. In order to be protected, the speech must:

1. Be of public interest.

Fritts's statement clearly passes this part of the test. The state can punish Fritts for speech that is not of public interest. For example, he could be fired for calling a fellow officer a whiny little bitch. Since whether or not that officer is a whiny little bitch is not a matter the public has to concern itself about, then the first amendment wouldn't protect him. However, what he said was, in fact, a matter of public interest. His statement passes this test.

2) Must be unofficial.

If Fritts's statement that civil authorities can execute homosexuals was a statement he made in his capacity as a state representative, then he could be punished, as the state can decide what it does and does not want to say. Notably, this does not apply to simply referencing one's work/etc. Simply saying ""As a police officer, I believe (X)"" would not qualify, as long as you don't pretend that's an official department policy. Once again, he passes.

The third point, though, as I understand it, is the one that concerns me. If the speech passes these two tests (which this does, and with flying colors,) it is subjected to the Pickering-Connick test. The Pickering-Connick test allows a person to be fired or otherwise administratively punished, even for unofficial statements of public interest, if the statement negatively effects the capacity of the state to carry out a valid state duty.

I can't speak for anyone else, but if I was involved in a Pride parade in Knoxville, I would be very concerned about cooperating with the police if it came up. If I was driving through town, I would consider trying to outrun a car instead of being pulled over, if I knew there was a deputy who thought that god gave the civil authorities the power to execute LGBT people. That seems to me like his statement is damaging the ability of the Knoxville Sherriff's Department to carry out the duties of law enforcement as a result.

I really don't like the thought of a pastor being fired for a religious statement, even if it's a pastor and statement I find deeply disturbing. But it seems to me like this is a case where he should be. Obviously it's good that he's being investigated for bias by an outside party, I would be really happy to hear that he didn't let such a bias effect his work. But even if it didn't, this seems to me to not be protected, and like something he should probably lose his badge over. After all, it seems like the issue would not be just if he let it effect his work, but if he has harmed the ability of his department to do its job.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Sweden
Raping of women by third world immigrants at a rate far higher than native people. In Sweden, 58% of the women raped was done by immigrants despite comprising around a fifth of the population as of 2017.

http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2015-003081_EN.html
1 400 white girls were abused, raped and murdered by Muslim gangs over a period of years. Many of these incidents are gang rapes. Many local city councils in England, Sweden, Norway and Denmark know very well how things stand, but conceal the real situation for fear of being accused of racism.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.euronews.com/amp/2017/11/24/which-eu-countries-have-the-highest-rate-of-sex-crimes-
Rape is correlated with Muslim immigration in every single country. Sweden, belgium and England + wales have the highest percentage of immigrants and rank 1, 2, and 3 in sexual assault. Again England+Wales and Sweden are 1 and 2 in rape. 

This isnt even mentioning overall crime rates which is higher for immigrants as well (Africans commit absurdly high amount of crime).


More facts:
On current trends European populations will become more ethnically diverse, with the possibility that today's majority ethnic groups will no longer comprise a numerical majority in some countries.


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_European_Union, the average EU couple is having 1.6 kids while migrant couples birth rate is far higher than that.

Some examples of native displacement: Right now only 44% and 49% of London and Frankfurt, respectively is white which is only going downward. 

Is this really what is wanted? Historical cities being replaced with populations completely foreign to them? London is not London anymore, the cultures, people, and traditions are all dwindling. 

Counter arguments I hear:
Natives against immigration are islamophobic: 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2017/06/21/author-muslims-killing-europe-not-assimilating/amp/
Well it is well known on reddit the kind of trash ideology that Islam is. From the treatment of women to gays, Islam is not a peaceful religion whatsoever. It manifests itself in the culture of Muslim immigrants which is part of the reason for so much rape. Women are second class citizens in their countries. And many immigrants are choosing NOT to ASSIMILATE. Islamic traditions could not be more incompatible with western ideals.

Counterargument 2:
Diversity is good!:

I have yet to hear 1 good idea for why diversity is good. ""Diversity allows for a range of different ideas."" Which is total BS. Europe has been getting along just fine being white the past century reaching new heights science, human rights, and overall quality of living. Diversity seems to be alone bad, let alone good. All I see is 3rd world immigrants bringing this standard of living down for EU members.

Counterargument 3:
The fix the dwindling birth rate among EU members and keeping the economy from sinking. I see a lot of contradicting articles on whether they present a net good or bad for economies in Europe. But take it to be true, why does Europe have to have huge economies in the first place? Is a smaller population and economy going to be the death of Europe? Also, governments can give incentives to their own people to stimulate birth production. Trends of EU birth rate has been going up, but I see it as more beneficial if a country invests in it's own people. EU countries should be diverging money towards making kids less costly and more convenient for people as possible. The solution doesnt always have to be more 3rd world immigrants.

Conclusion:
People screaming xenophobia and islamophobia have a lot of questions to answer. This discussion is not going away and this bottled up hatred felt by many European members is just opening up the door way for the election of future fascists and strong men to change immigration policies. I mean, just read about the migrant rape crisis involving gangs of men raping and groping scores of women, they deserve answers and not a blind eye to the perils of immigration by the current EU governments because they dont want to seem racist.

So it seems like a lot of people are divided on the sexual assault/rape claims. My first two sources dont necessarily conclude it. Do Muslim and african immigration correlate with more sexual assault/rape? And if so, is it negligible or significance enough that it should be addressed? I find conflicting sources on both sides which yields skepticism on how that could be. This should be easily statistically proven and settled, yet there is plenty of disagreement.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muslim and African immigration at the current level is not good for Europeans &lt;/p&gt;

Common practice on a résumé is to list prior work and education experience with _dates_, e.g. ""I was employed at company X June 2012 - May 2015"", rather than (or in addition to) tenure length, e.g. ""I was employed at company X for 2 years, 11 months"".

I think this is problematic for (at least) three reasons:

1. Age discrimination. It is illegal (in the US at least) to discriminate against someone for being too old, and (in my state) it's even illegal to ask about age or leading questions (or if not strictly illegal, legally discouraged). However, by listing the years you attended school or had a first job, it's impossible to ignore age. Of course, you might be able to infer age by looking at experience (e.g. if you worked on a really old technology) or just total number of years, but I hypothesize that this would have a less negative effect. It would look like having a lot of experience, whereas seeing ""graduated class of 1980"" and then you think ""wow that was before I was born"" I think you (as a hiring manager) may be more likely to have a negative feeling associated with age here.

2. Gaps due to extended medical leave, e.g. raising children for a few years. A huge problem facing some professional women today who want to start families is getting back into the job market after a several year gap. I personally have heard from a few people who face this, and even if you've kept your skills up to date as best as possible, getting that first job after a gap can be super hard. Same if you had medical leave (physical or mental) or a gap due to caring for a family member. Or imagine you spent a year in prison falsely convicted and then were released and expunged of wrongdoing (don't want to derail this CMV to be about prison / criminals, just an example). By listing years of experience rather than dates, these gaps will be invisible at first glance.

3. The ability to leave off ""bad"" or ""embarrassing"" experience. Depending on the field, sometimes a resume can get dragged down by a bad name. E.g. imagine if you were some rank-and-file attorney at Enron or Lehman Brothers. Chances are you had nothing to do with the massive problems that happened there, but it could seem like a black mark. Or, maybe you took a job working tech support for a porn site and would rather leave that off your resume. In any of these cases it's probably not OK to lie to an interviewer about it, but not having it on you resume which is often a first impression could be a huge help. Resumes already don't need to be comprehensive (especially if you have a lot of experience and want to fit it on one page).

As far as how this should be achieved, I don't really want to get into a big policy debate but I think a reasonable step might be a law making it illegal to require exact dates, or at least just making it common / encouraged practice to use (only) tenure lengths instead.

Theoretically, people could just start doing this now, but without some kind of legal backing or at least making it a common and well-known practice, it wouldn't fly, especially when someone is in the (often) vulnerable position of applying for employment.

I also think there are some caveats here, for example if your employer needs to run a background check they might need to know your graduation or employment dates for confirmation (though I think that could fundamentally be avoided too, but confirming tenure lengths rather than dates). Similarly, as said above, asking about types of technologies or coworkers or anything like that during an interview might reveal information about dates, or perhaps past employers all need to be disclosed on a form during reference checks. That's fine, I think, but I still think they should stay off the resume to avoid tainting the initial impression of the interviewee.

EDIT: if a law were passed, it should be illegal for the _employer_ to ask for demand dates, no penalty for the employee (i.e. all existing resumes aren't suddenly illegal).

EDIT2: clarified my pregnancy example to be a few year gap rather than just the weeks of FMLA leave.

&lt;p&gt;Renewables, besides hydro, cannot change energy output levels fast enough or reliably enough to support large swings of power demand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing hydro generation requires more dams to be built, which are currently shown to negatively impact the environment. &lt;/p&gt;

I believe that in most cases America is a land of equal opportunity where everyone has the chance to succeed if they work hard and have a vision. It doesn't matter who you are, your race, or your socioeconomic background. I don't believe that there's widespread, systemic racism (I haven't yet seen any legitimate evidence, so please feel free to share if you have it). I don't believe that black people and minorities are any less or any more capable of accomplishing anything in life than a white person, vice versa.

I do not disagree with certain facts/claims that have led to the creation of the term white privilege. For example, black people tend to live in poorer communities and consequently don't have access to similar resources that others in richer communities have. That's a fact. I disagree, however, with the assumption that it's because white people are somehow more privileged or have created a system that prevents black people and other minorities from accessing better resources.

With this in mind, my reasons for getting rid of the phrase are as follows:

1. It does not create a healthy/productive mindset for black people and other minorities. This is because it promotes a culture of resentment and victim hood. It leads people to complain that it's not their fault, that others are causing the problems, and that others should fix the problem. It also engenders distrust, and causes minorities to doubt the honest, good intentions of white people trying to tackle difficult societal problems in the ways they feel are best.
2. It does not create a healthy/productive mindset for white people. It essentially tells anyone who's white that they have done something wrong, that they are the cause of the problem, etc. White people almost always either accept this conclusion and feel like they can't have any say in the conversation, or will be enraged and strongly push back against any of the ideas (legitimate or not) that have led to the creation of the term white privilege.
3. It reinforces identity politics. There's nothing wrong with recognizing different groups of people and how members of these groups are similar (in experiences, problems they face, etc.). But, we cannot let this become our only focus. In today's political climate arguments are consistently centered around groups or identities. This is true for both ends of the political spectrum. We are widening the divide between these groups and essentially pitting them against each other, making it difficult to promote the unity and compromise needed to pass meaningful legislation that will benefit Americans. Claims of white privilege don't do anything to diminish the growth of identity politics and should be abandoned.
4. It keeps us from focusing on other factors that contribute to the problems the black community and other minorities face. For example, one such factor is fatherless homes. Studies continually show that traditional nuclear families, where both a mother and father are present to raise the kids, are much better at helping children succeed and stay out of trouble than those homes with a single mother or father. The black community has the highest rate of single mothers/fatherless homes, however facts like this are overshadowed when white privilege is continually touted as the primary problem.

Please note that I'm not trying to say that problems don't exist, that racism doesn't exist, or that black people and minorities have nothing to complain about. My argument is to get rid of the phrase and re frame the problem in what I feel should be a more helpful/productive way.

In May 2019, I made the decision to switch to the Pixel 3a XL and this phone has changed my opinion of Android. I absolutely love the device and the experience it offers and would like to offer why I believe the Pixel experience is the best way to experience Android.

## Premise 1: The way Google intended

The Google Pixel is a unique line of devices that offers smartphone users something they can otherwise get only from Apple. It offers a software experience that is fine-tunes to the hardware. Like with iOS and iPhone are developed by Apple, Pixel is made by the same company that develops Android. This has an obvious advantage of providing a software experience that third-party OEMs like Sony, Samsung, and Nokia cannot provide. Since Google has control over the hardware and software, Google can add unique features like *Call Screen* and  *Active Edge* that other OEMs aren't interested in adding to their devices. 


## Premise 2: Timely software updates

Also since Google is responsible for the software experience, Google can push out software updates at a faster pace than other OEMs. Software fragmentation is a serious problem that plagues Android to this day due to wireless carriers and third-party OEMs. With the Pixel line, Google can bypass all of those barriers and push out updates with ease. For someone who wants the latest Android updates, the Pixel line is the ideal choice.

## Premise 3: Little to no bloatware

Many Android OEMs add bloatware apps to their devices which unnecessarily take up space and add no value to the life of the user. For instance, Samsung adds bloatware apps to their devices. Many users dislike the presence of bloatware apps and usually these apps cannot be removed since they are registered as system apps. Android users would have to root their device in order to gain the ability to remove those applications. The Pixel only includes default system apps and Google apps. The only preinstalled app that I do not use on my Pixel 3a XL is the Android Auto app.

## Premise 3: The best cameras on smartphones.

From the initial release of the original Google Pixel, the Pixel line has been praised for their amazing cameras. Usually, Android cameras are criticized for poor image quality and shoddy colors. The Pixel line contains some of the best cameras found in smartphones. For people who care about image quality, then this might be a compelling reason to buy a Pixel.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been using Android since 2011 throughout my experience with the platform, I noticed that many of the Android phones offered by third party OEMs do not provide timely updates and come loaded with bloatware.

I would never date/have sex with any trans person because of their status as trans, and that does NOT make me transphobic.  I believe that lumping in people who have this sexual preference with people who spread hate is wrong and tantamount to bullying.  I'd be interested to see if there are any arguments as to why my sexual preference should be considered transphobic.

Clarification:  I do not hate or bear ill will toward trans people.  They deserve the same rights as everyone else, and I will use their preferred pronouns and treat them as whatever gender they want.  I just categorically refuse to date or enter into a sexual relationship with a trans person.  I am a straight cis male, and I only prefer biological females.

Justification/Background:  I'm posting this because of a very heated argument I had with a person at a bar re: trans people.  I was accused of being a transphobe for not wanting to date trans people.  This is a serious charge to throw at someone, and I was very angered by it, because I do not consider myself to be a hateful person.

Arguments/Reasoning:

First, the fantastical, hypothetical scenario that was presented to me of the ""most beautiful trans woman ever"" who is perfect in every way, so you could never tell, seems absurd and doesn't reflect reality.  Of course there are trans women who look like cis women.  But even the most beautiful trans women I've seen, like say Blaire White or Eden The Doll, still have masculine features (jawlines, shoulders, necks, etc.).  But that's not even the main argument I'm making.

The point is, the mere knowledge that someone does have/used to have a penis is enough to kill any sexual desire I had for that person (i.e., my dick is not going to get hard).  Anyone seriously saying I'm transphobic or bigoted because I wouldn't be able to get an erection if I knew someone is trans really needs to offer a good explanation.  I don't care how ""hot"" or ""perfect"" or ""identical to a cis woman"" they are, that knowledge alone is going to kill it for me.  And that feeling isn't born from hatred or invalidation of trans people, it's just a sexual preference that I can't even control.  It isn't some minuscule mental hangup, it's a full stop sexual deal-breaker.  If anyone tries to claim that if only I would ""self-reflect on my internal prejudices and recognize my bias then I'd want to have sex with a trans woman"" they obviously don't understand how sexual arousal works.  It's as much psychological as it is physical.  And it's not something I'm going to ever get past, nor do I feel the need to.

Furthermore, a neovagina is different from a natal vagina, and the idea of an orifice crafted from penile or scrotal tissue that needs to be constantly dilated to avoid closing is just NOT sexually appealing to me in any way (see above re: arousal).  And please don't say I'd need to try it to know if I really liked it or not.  I've also never tried having sex with a man but I'm 100% sure I wouldn't like it.  I don't think there's any way anyone can convince me that a neovagina is going to taste, smell, and feel the same as a natal vagina.  

Now, if I said ""I would never date trans women BECAUSE I hate trans people"" or because ""trans people are weird or icky"" or something like that, then by all means, that would be transphobic.  But to say that my personal sexual desires and turn-ons (or lack thereof due to someone's trans status) is indicative of some kind of bigotry or phobia, whether conscious or not, is not only disingenuous, but it is bullying and harmful.  Transphobia *should* be a word reserved for negative attitudes and behaviors toward trans people that can cause them harm.  A sexual preference does not and should not fall into this category.  

I'd also like to point out that there are PLENTY of cis people who have no problem dating or engaging in sexual activity with a trans person.  I don't see how trying to shame or demonize someone for their preferences of not dating trans people is productive.  Again, I AM open to having my view changed if someone can provide a valid reason as to why sexual preferences are transphobic; perhaps this involves a larger conversation as to what things fall under the definition of transphobia.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would never date/have sex with any trans person because of their status as trans, and that does NOT make me transphobic.  I believe that lumping in people who have this sexual preference with people who spread hate is wrong and tantamount to bullying.  I&amp;#39;d be interested to see if there are any arguments as to why my sexual preference should be considered transphobic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clarification:  I do not hate or bear ill will toward trans people.  They deserve the same rights as everyone else, and I will use their preferred pronouns and treat them as whatever gender they want.  I just categorically refuse to date or enter into a sexual relationship with a trans person.  I am a straight cis male, and I only prefer biological females.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justification/Background:  I&amp;#39;m posting this because of a very heated argument I had with a person at a bar re: trans people.  I was accused of being a transphobe for not wanting to date trans people.  This is a serious charge to throw at someone, and I was very angered by it, because I do not consider myself to be a hateful person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguments/Reasoning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the fantastical, hypothetical scenario that was presented to me of the &amp;quot;most beautiful trans woman ever&amp;quot; who is perfect in every way, so you could never tell, seems absurd and doesn&amp;#39;t reflect reality.  Of course there are trans women who look like cis women.  But even the most beautiful trans women I&amp;#39;ve seen, like say Blaire White or Eden The Doll, still have masculine features (jawlines, shoulders, necks, etc.).  But that&amp;#39;s not even the main argument I&amp;#39;m making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is, the mere knowledge that someone does have/used to have a penis is enough to kill any sexual desire I had for that person (i.e., my dick is not going to get hard).  Anyone seriously saying I&amp;#39;m transphobic or bigoted because I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to get an erection if I knew someone is trans really needs to offer a good explanation.  I don&amp;#39;t care how &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;identical to a cis woman&amp;quot; they are, that knowledge alone is going to kill it for me.  And that feeling isn&amp;#39;t born from hatred or invalidation of trans people, it&amp;#39;s just a sexual preference that I can&amp;#39;t even control.  It isn&amp;#39;t some minuscule mental hangup, it&amp;#39;s a full stop sexual deal-breaker.  If anyone tries to claim that if only I would &amp;quot;self-reflect on my internal prejudices and recognize my bias then I&amp;#39;d want to have sex with a trans woman&amp;quot; they obviously don&amp;#39;t understand how sexual arousal works.  It&amp;#39;s as much psychological as it is physical.  And it&amp;#39;s not something I&amp;#39;m going to ever get past, nor do I feel the need to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a neovagina is different from a natal vagina, and the idea of an orifice crafted from penile or scrotal tissue that needs to be constantly dilated to avoid closing is just NOT sexually appealing to me in any way (see above re: arousal).  And please don&amp;#39;t say I&amp;#39;d need to try it to know if I really liked it or not.  I&amp;#39;ve also never tried having sex with a man but I&amp;#39;m 100% sure I wouldn&amp;#39;t like it.  I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s any way anyone can convince me that a neovagina is going to taste, smell, and feel the same as a natal vagina.  &lt;/p&gt;

I’ve had many experiences, albeit anecdotally, with green ‘activists’ (and on a couple of occasions Green Party councillors) emphasising their total opposition to nuclear power. This is in fact quite a pervasive opinion even within groups focused on addressing the issues posed by climate change (and I’m sure the recent tv series Chernobyl won’t help matters!).

So, a couple of things about nuclear power:

1. It is a safe form of renewable energy generation. The major accident in the history of nuclear power generation was a fatal design flaw motivated by a lack of money and occurred within a closed state system. Modern reactors are extremely safe, albeit quite expensive.

2. Next generation nuclear reactors are even more efficient, require less maintenance and have more resilient cooling systems.

3. Nuclear fuel is abundant. 

4. Nuclear power creates reliable, well paid jobs. This is true across the supply chain and also in nuclear decommissioning can create jobs in deprived communities. This could be one of the ways to regenerate former manufacturing communities that have been hit hard by globalisation.

5. Investment in a swathe of new reactors and standardisation can cut the cost of renewing plants.


Ok, and in terms of the problems with other forms of renewables:

1. Most forms of renewable energy are inefficient, less reliable and do not provide 24/7 energy generation.

2. Renewables relying on photovoltaic panels, wind generators and batteries are resource intensive and less environmentally friendly as they require extracting cobalt and lithium in substantial quantities. 

3. In the USA in 2017, nuclear energy provided 805 TWh of power (around 20% of the total). Other renewables, excluding hydropower, provided 387 TWh, or 9.6% of the total.

I will, however, try to make the arguments from the assumption that religion isn't all bad, that reasoned faith (as opposed to blind faith or faith solely based on emotion) in a religion is indeed an ideal. Reasoned faith (as I would define it, feel free to challenge this definition) is faith that is borne out of rational engagement with the dogma and knowledge of a given religion.

This view comes from my personal experience observing the activities of Christian Sunday schools. ""Educational activities"" usually involve drilling into children messages such as ""I love Jesus"" and ""God is great"", and children are encouraged by teachers and peers alike when they demonstrate a greater degree of fervent faith. I am arguing that such practices and other ways that children are exposed to religion, at best, teach children that blindly believing in their religion is an ideal, and at worst akin to brainwashing. Hopefully you fine redditors can broaden my view when it comes to other religions as well that I am less familiar with.

I have heard arguments from parents that their children want to go to church. And why wouldn't they? It'll make their parents happy seeing their child with such unshakeable conviction. Or they'll get to spend time with their friends. Children are not considered in the eyes of most laws globally to be able to give consent (in the broadest sense), or be held accountable and responsible for their actions. This is supported by our understanding of neurological development which tells us that a child's brain is vastly different from adult's. Given all these incentives to go to church unrelated to a commitment to recent faith, why should we bring the child to church, knowing that it will likely only develop their ability to blindly believe?

Thinking from the perspective of psychological development, we know that early childhood experience has a huge impact on behavior later in life. When we expose children to these beliefs with none of the nuance that accompanies (some) religious sermons and text, doesn't it make sense that many of these children will go on to believe that blind faith is the ideal, even if they're told otherwise as adults? We also see lots of children leaving religions as they mature, some comparing their childhood experiences with religion to brainwashing.

My policy proposal here is that children not be allowed to be involved with religion until they reach an age where they can make informed decisions regarding their beliefs (probably a recognised age of adulthood, although something as early as 16 might be safe). Failing that, some form of safeguards to ensure minimal appeals to emotion in any religious teachings directed at children.

I recognise the problem that you can't really insulate children from religion simply because religious parents will (consciously or otherwise) teach their children morals and beliefs linked to their religion. That's inevitable, but if we agree that children will have great difficulty taking up religion through reasoned faith, then the intent of my policy proposal still stands: minimising exposure of children to religion. I view organised religious activity as the best place to target.

In anticipation of those who might say that secularism is a religion too (thanks Naomi!), I acknowledge its history but will nonetheless assume it here to be the ""default setting"" (especially since many governments are secular) and argue that it occupies a neutral place in society.

One of the arguments against taxation is that property rights do not exist outside a society which protects them. Basically, it is society which determines whether a person can own property and whether that property can be taken away.

The problem is that the counterargument is really convincing. It basically says that even if you wash up on an island inhabited by a single fisherman, it is still morally wrong of you to take his fishing spear, or his fish, etc. and I agree. Theft is wrong even if there is no society or government to protect property rights.  
Another counterargument is that society has in the past given property rights over other people (slavery), and that was obviously morally wrong, even though society decided it to be legal.

This is more concerning a situation where one person is simultaneously ""dating"" more than one person, none of whom have any idea the others exist.

This is coming out of a situation where I ran into a girl I was seeing on a date. We had really just started getting together frequently but all signs were pointing to things going really well. A few days went by and I didn't mention anything because I didn't just want to assume it was a date, but then when she texted me asking why I hadn't hit her up recently so I asked what the deal was with the other guy, who had her hands all over her and she seemed into it during the brief moment I saw them before she saw me. Without even hesitating, she just blatantly said she was on a date and got defensive before I even responded. Quite frankly, I was upset and I'm still kind of annoyed about it, and it didn't make it any better when she justified it to me by saying she's not looking for anything monogamous or serious. 

Usually when people feel led on, it's because nothing sexual or romantic happens. In this situation, she totally treated me like we were getting somewhere but in her mind I was just a fwb. If that were clear from the get go, I'm not sure I would have complained, but she let me get attached.

In any event, and I don't mean to sound too conservative or too bitter because I'm basically over it at this point, I'm writing this because I feel like there's a relationship between how we've empowered young people, especially women, to have a lot of no strings attached sex. How some people, of any gender, have taken this is that it's ok to test out  multiple relationships at the same time before making a decision. 

Many people don't do this, so I don't want to sound like I'm making huge blanket statements, but I'm not sure how people are supposed to trust relationships if it's considered appropriate to be half in half out of every relationship and commitment. People today are more selfish and more flaky and more indecisive than ever, and I really just think its because society has overemphasized the importance of having options. I think it's incredibly selfish to test out those options while dating someone, no matter how early on in the relationship it is. If you aren't sure about someone, break up with them.

EDIT: I'm getting a lot of people questioning whether or not I understand what dating means. I know in my post that I was clearly caught off guard, but I don't doubt that this is something that could have happened. I'm specifically saying that I believe the promotion of the shopping form of dating is wrong and people should stop doing it. Nobody has challenged me on that yet. 

EDIT 2: As much as I love sitting here and reading how presumptuous I am or how dumb I am for wanting some security, this post is and always has been about how I feel people *should* act. I have no illusions about what kind of shady shit people do to each other in reality, but I think that's wrong and I identified vaguely some reasons why these things have become normal.

Firstly when you rely solely on Youtube to promote your video (even if a creator is content creator is funded through Patreon they rely on Youtube for distribution) and monetization, you are willingly dealing with a sketchy party. You can argue whether its morally right for Youtube to suppress certain political speech but the fact is they currently have the legal right to do so. Not only this, they have a history of banning demonitizing an suppressing  certain views. In short Youtube is a company more concerned about being politically correct rather than backing their creators. Its stupid to put all your eggs in a basket that's so volatile.

One  other reason is because if you get too large and become a target for the mainstream media, your name will likely be smeared, making it difficult to find employment and your reputation will be severely damaged. The mainstream media will go to great lengths to dig through your content and try to take any off handed comment and try to blow it up. Take for example the Media relentlessly going after Carl Benjamin for saying he WOULDN'T rape someone. This is because the MSM feel threatened by independent creators taking their market share.

Now lately I've been struggling a lot with depression and suicidal thoughts. In the past I used to see this therapist (I mean he was good, and had won multiple awards and was regarded as one of the best in the area), but he was absurdly expensive, and was too busy to even give me a fucking weekly appointment. If he really cared about me, wouldn't he try his best to give me a weekly appointment? Yet this dude was charging upwards of $1000-$1200 per hour (that's not a joke). Then my current therapist who is a lot more reasonably priced went out of her way to explain cancellation fees to me and all the reasons insurance providers aren't accepted, blah blah blah. I feel like doctors don't personally care, I feel like any therapist that says ""don't kill yourself"", is just trying to avoid liabilities and is afraid of losing your money as a patient.

&amp;#x200B;

And what about all the doctors prescribing opioids, yes, dangerous fucking painkillers to patients that don't really need them because they make extra money?

A post that I feel like writing because of what I've seen recently on the internet after Cyberpunk's 2077 show on E3 2019. Of course after the Keanu Reeves hype.  


I've been playing games, watching movies and tv shows, stand-ups, listening to songs, everything that can be called entertainment - I've witnessed it for years now. But in recent times I've noticed that people are trying to add agendas to some of those things, because they contain the topic in some way etc. And it bugs me. At first, I wanted to engage those people, ask them, say that they are wrong. But I agree with Ricky Gervais on that one - I saw something public, someone's opinion and I took it personally, got offended instead of dealing with my own emotions and ignoring it. But I do want to educate myself.

&amp;#x200B;

But, to be specific and lay out an example first. If someone doesn't know - Cyberpunk 2077 is the most anticipated game as of today in the whole world. It's a huge open-world RPG set in 2077 in a dystopian world that got taken over by corporations. The point of people on the internet bashing the game is that it can be somewhat racist/homophobic (or they don't say that directly, so ""inappropriate"" and ""worrying""). Their major point being that in the game there is an advertisement of an energy drink with a ""MIX IT UP"" and ""16 flavours you'd love to mix"" caption in the game and a person that looks like a woman at first look, but actually has a hidden ""package"".   


Now yes, this sounds bizzare, but it's aimed to be in the world the devs created. It's honestly just a screenshot, so we can't know what it's about. Nothing more to it, really... right? Well, no. Some people got outraged that it's transphobic. I have no idea in what way, but it's offensive for them. Now fairly enough, I am not from the LGBTQ community and maybe I just can't understand how can it be offensive. But some of other points are: in the trailer, hero shoots members of a gang called ""Animals"" and some of those members are black. Anything to it? Not if you want to see it. Animals? Black people? THOSE RASCALS ARE RACIST! On the main cover there is a white male? Well, that just proves the point, right?

&amp;#x200B;

And honestly, it's not the first time. In my opinion, those people are trying to find a political message to be upset about, even though it's not there. Developers created a world, fictional world (yes, based on an already fictional world of CP2020) and it's a video game! There is no hidden message or parallels to today's world. It's a form of entertainment that's been created for you for hours to enjoy. It's not a manipulative work of evil. You just want it to be, for some reason.

&amp;#x200B;

And yes, I understand that some works may contain political message or something, but it's usually really visible and direct. Not something that plugs into your subconscience and change your views of the world. And even if it is, it's just a side product of the world created and the fact that you got immersed in it. 

&amp;#x200B;

And besides that, why would anyone think that developers want to include some hidden, racist or homophobic message? Do some people really just think some of the people are like that? 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, this whole thing, looking for hidden agendas and politics in something you should be mindlessly enjoying is so tiring. There's a ton of assumptions without context and building this ridiculous argument so you can justify being upset. And I know, I may be speaking about a minority, usually such things are the most visible and the majority of people just ignores everything and it won't affect anything in any way whatsoever, but I do want to know if there's anything more to know here.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hiya!  &lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

They know nothing of bullying, how to curtail it, and don’t do anything but throw a ‘band-aid’ on a matter that they refuse to address. I go on these groups, people will go there to cry, vent, whine, whine, etc.. the people on these message boards, never give any “Tangible” solution to anything.

&amp;#x200B;

The kids or people might as well go to your local Priest and go whine to him about your problems as he just blesses you, and gives you proverb that does nothing to better your life or situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was banned (as were other people) from a group on here for giving a kid tangible advice about how to combat bullying. I tell the same things. Go get in shape, work hard at something, keep your dreams at this moment to yourself, if you need to, go to the local gym, learn self-defense, kickboxing, anything (doesn’t matter), since once you learn to ‘protect’ yourself, you won’t actually really have to fight, and you’ll realize that most of the things other people say, don’t mean much (unless it’s against your race, or family, then fight away).

&amp;#x200B;

I think it’s because a lot of people that control or run these groups, didn’t have the balls, or fortitude to handle their ‘bullying’ while they were in school, or around the culprits that did it when they knew them. They cowered, ran away, etc… It just ends up being people that are 20 years removed from it, whining about “I was bullied, I know how you feel” which is great, why not give the person actual solution to their problem, so they’re not another 50-year-old person, stunted in life, whining about bullying? I know, I mean, actually, help them. (Also getting angry at posters that overcame bullying, or actually did it whilst in high school or during the time, give actual advice. They get jealous, angry, or annoyed by it.)

&amp;#x200B;

But, nope, they want more people to just another ‘soapbox’ to cry on. I had it rough, moved to a new school, some girl liked me, a different race than the majority, and from another town (that town hated, I was forced to be bussed in, damn “district line”) and those kids made my life hell, with encouragement from the teachers (Scumbags, never realized how evil adults can be, until then. I couldn’t imagine being 52 years old, and pulling the things this degenerate scumbag teacher (and his peers) pulled on us at that  young of an age, sabotage, fights, instigation, no wonder 45% of the white kids from that school I went to are drug addicts, with severe problems). Those same kids went to my jr. high. I had one that was a ‘fake friend’ that would use me to go to parties or meet girls, then throw me under the bus to ‘get cool’ with them, like I was the town ‘whipping boy’. I had enough in 8th grade, changed it up, 9th grade I got popular, 10th grade I decided to play sports since “Fuck it, why not?” yeah, people talked crap, laughed, but I went in, got better, got good. Then I ended up getting popular, being cool, and beating the crap out of all the bullies that bullied me back then.

&amp;#x200B;

I earned my name and respect, with the savages. Sometimes in life, to “Beat a savage, you have to beat a savage”. I’m not going to go to war and in the middle of a shooting spree, become a ‘pacifist’ and just “hope” the people that don’t know me, or my beliefs, won’t do what they’re trained to do, which is killing me.

&amp;#x200B;

It just irks me. I recall when I was being ‘bullied’ asking for help, and teachers, people, just “left me” to figure it out. No advice, nothing. Then to go to a Reddit page, or websites, ask for advice, and be told crap like, “Well, I had it bad too”. “It’s not your fault”, “I feel you”, “they’re a-holes”, “they should know better” etc… without any tangible advice that is going to make some 14-year-old person’s life better, or easier.

&amp;#x200B;

Then to be chastised for giving them “Actual advice” since the website or group needs “clicks” for their ads, or B.S., so, what do they want? A kid that got bullied comes there, finds a solution, and is no more bullied, so they don’t have to keep coming to the site to vent every week, or 5 days, or a kid that is distraught, almost suicidal, crying each day, coming to the sight, over and over again to “Wax poetically” about how hard they have it…(though these same people, will “Cry” about their bullying, but won’t give a care to the actual “bullying” of minorities in the society they live in… but, what do I know?)

&amp;#x200B;

It annoys me. Please, change my mind on how these people, campaigns, etc.. operate and tell me these things do something actually good. Since I think it’s just a place for people who got bullied while in their youth who are mods or site owners, to get clicks some money, and to feel ‘superior’ or like they’re ‘actually helping’ without tangibly doing anything.

&amp;#x200B;

It reminds me of when I was in college and we had all these “Pre-med clubs” that people made. I want to a majority Asian college (ABC and Immigrants) and we had clubs that were “Chinese American Medical club” “Chinese Medical Club”, “1st generation Chinese Medical Club”, “Singapore Medical Club” “2nd Generation Chinese American medical Club”, “Japanese Medical Club”, “Japanese American Medical Club”, “Vietnamese Medical Club” etc…( you get the picture, and if anyone went to a UC in California, you know exactly what I’m alluding to). I didn’t mind the groups, fine. But when I was on student board (We decided which clubs got funding, checked what they did, etc..)

&amp;#x200B;

Every single club was just a made up, “paper club” for them to claim on their transcripts that they were “President or Vice President” of the club to get into medical school, or graduate school. Even when we had our quota’s they barely turned in 1 community service thing twice a year, and they barely ever did it. It was just a glorified way for the presidents and vice president fake kids to get something on their transcript, get money to have pizza parties they wanted, or go out. But the members got no tangible benefits, help with the MCAT, nothing… That’s what all these groups remind me of, and all the ones on Reddit. Pathetic.

Ok, so just so we're clear on impeachment: it will not remove the president from office. That would require 2/3rds of the Senate's approval. I don't mean to insult your intelligence, but the number of twitter comments not distinguishing between impeachment and conviction has me a bit worried.

The thing is, impeachment in election season is highly risky. It's likely that if Donald Trump is impeached, he'll get re-elected in 2020, and now we have to live under that nightmare until 2024.


Ok, so up until this point I've been assuming impeachment won't constitute removal from office. But let's change that. Say the Republican senators are tired of Trump, and vote to remove him from office. We now have president Mike Pence. And he is a *Hardline* conservative. And we can't impeach him too, because Republicans won't have a President Nancy Pelosi.

I am open to change, though. There's something to be said for the moral duty by the house.

I also can tell you that a couple of years back, I had a casual job for a particular business (won't say who) doing their social media, and one of my jobs, was to post fake positive reviews for the business on as many places as I could, from as many accounts as I could. If you have the time (which I did, it was what I was paid to do) it's pretty easy to set up fake emails/accounts/facebook profiles, and just post whatever you like.

When it comes to movies and video games you have super fans who either want to support a franchise so they flood sites with fake positive reviews, or people who feel like their favourite franchise has been ruined so they flood those same sites with 0 star reviews.

There are bots, trolls, people with ulterior motives, and paid shills everywhere on the internet.

And finally you have real people posting genuine reviews, but they are just dumb people. A Vietnamese restaurant opened in my area for example that I thought was really good, but you had people posting bad reviews because you couldn't get kung pow chicken, or sushi, or other non-Vietnamese foods.

Basically my argument is that user reviews are a waste of your time when considering whether to buy a product, or use a service.

Ever since the Brexit referendum in June 2016 the UK has struggled to decide what Brexit actually looks like (apart from the nebulous “Brexit means Brexit”). 

Full disclosure: I voted to remain in the referendum and continue to think remaining is the best course of action, although I’m not sure if it’s an option anymore. There has been a lot of talk recently about a second referendum, also referred to as a “People’s vote”. This is mainly advocated by pro-remain groups who believe that given the chaos of the last couple years the British people will have changed their mind and would vote to remain. I personally would love to remain, but I cannot convince myself that a second referendum is the right thing to do and if we did do it I really don’t think the result would be different.

I’ve outlined a couple of the reasons why I think this below:

· The original referendum was meant to settle this for good, many people advocating for a second referendum argue that the electorate weren’t well informed about the choices (which I agree with), however, I can’t think of a single election or campaign which didn’t involve lies or misleading claims so why do we suddenly decide to re-run this one?

· Leading on from that I do worry about what effect this would have on our democracy, like I said I’m pro-remain but even I get frustrated with the patronising tone taken by a number of second referendum campaigners. Much of the vote for Brexit was due to anti-establishment feeling. I’m not sure how liberal elites over-ruling the votes of many working class people (which is how it would be portrayed regardless of whether it’s true or not) would help this situation. 

· Finally, I really believe that if there was a second referendum then leave would win, probably by a bigger margin. Many people point to polls and the recent EU elections to show that sentiment has changed. But all these are from small groups, even the EU elections had a turnout of about half that of the original referendum (17.1 million voted in the EU elections altogether, as opposed to 17.4 million who voted just for leave in 2016) so I would hesitate to draw any sweeping conclusions from it. I believe many people are just fed up with the process, even I as a pro-remainer have had moments where I’d happily just leave and get it done with and I believe that much of the British people probably have the same levels of fatigue, especially considering we’ve spoken about nothing else for 3 years!

I’d love to hear what you all think and change my view. I’ve not specified what the question would be on the second referendum (no deal vs deal or leave vs remain), my arguments hopefully apply to all potential referendum questions but feel free to explain your thinking about individual ballot questions. My view would be changed by people who can either convince me that there has been a monumental sea change in public opinion on Brexit, or by showing how a second referendum could be held in way which didn’t exacerbate the underlying divisions which lead to the original Brexit vote.

This is because the Babylonians based their mathematics, medicine, and astronomy on observation and practice much more fully than the Greeks, for example with Plato claiming that knowledge was innate and that people need only to recover that which is inside them. Another example is how while the Classical Greeks had a bizarre philosophical distaste for zero as a number, the Babylonians had no problem with it, and indeed used the world's first positional numeral system.

In contrast to the Babylonian observational philosophy for obtaining knowledge, Greek thought was based on pure theoretical thinking and internal reasoning. This is a critical difference, as observation is the basis for all modern science, while the Greek theoretical method, though influential in abstract philosophy, I would argue held back Europe until its Scientific Revolution.

This is a critical difference, as observation is the basis for all modern science, while the Greek theoretical method, though influential in abstract philosophy, I would argue held back Europe until its Scientific Revolution. Thus, the Greeks, though they gave the West its literature and culture, are not the founders of science. That honor goes to the Babylonians.&lt;/p&gt;

In your typical (American) school, students have a daily class schedule that consists of 6-7 class periods of 45-50 minutes each. Each class period is a different subject, and it takes several months to complete this set of courses.

I think it would be much better for everyone involved if the system was changed to focus on a single subject at a time. Students would spend 8 hours (with breaks of course) each day for 1-2 weeks learning a single subject. Over the course of each day, the class would alternate between lectures and lab time. The teacher teaches a topic, then the students do a lab to get practice and can ask for help if needed. The next week(s) they would go to a different class and learn a different subject.

The benefits of doing this would include (but not be limited to):

1. Students only have to keep track of 1 subject at a time. This would be much less stressful and less confusing.
2. Students only need to carry 1 textbook at a time and don't need to move between classrooms all day. No more back/shoulder problems caused by carrying multiple books in a backpack.
3. Students have less variance in the amount of homework they need to do each night (or possibly no homework necessary at all).

After searching around, I came to realize that they could be considered to be talking about different things.  Polytheism is just a belief that there are powerful supernatural entities, which even some monotheists believe.  Monotheism is a much more specific claim about the nature of reality.  The creator.  The uncaused causer.  Omniscient, omnipresent, and omnipotent.  The alpha and omega.

That makes sense, but it doesn't describe Abrahamic religion at all in my experience.  These religions often describe God as in conflict with parts (religions, ethnicities, the abstract concept of sin) of what they claim to be his creation.  He takes sides in conflicts, and seems to change his plans based on new information.

God, in the stories, never actually demonstrates omnipotence.  I can't think of anything he's described as doing in the Bible that a superhero from Marvel or DC couldn't do.  To demonstrate omnipotence, he'd have to show not just power over physical things, but over reality and logic itself.

There would be no point in praying to such an entity.  He would already know what you want, and already have decided whether or not you'll get it.  It would be nonsense to describe other religions as worshiping ""false gods"" because by definition there couldn't be more than one.  I don't accuse flat-Earthers of living on a ""false Earth"".  It's the same Earth, because there isn't and can't be another.

I know the standard answer to this objection is ""free will"", but that doesn't make sense without limiting God.  If it was his will that we have free will, why would he be upset at its practice?  If he knew he was going to be upset by it, why not do whatever he wants to do another way?  Would a parent ever give their child a choice, then punish them for choosing wrongly?  What would be the point, other than emotional abuse?

Basically, I think that if one believes in a capital-G God, the only way one can really put that into practice in a logically consistent way is to take a pantheistic approach, where all things are God's will, including the actions of people belonging to other religions and ethnicities.

I'm not arguing for simulation theory either. Because obviously there is always going to be some difference between physical reality and virtual reality, but in spite of that, I'm arguing that- that difference between (physical and virtual experience) will appear to get SMALLER and smaller the more that virtual reality immersion increases.

This video shows players killing stabbing a VR character to death. Notice that the players actual physical movements- are closely synchronous to the physical movements of actually stabbing someone. Notice I use the word ""movement"" here, because that's all that killing really requires. Specific movements that are engaged in virtual reality may eventually become synonymous to the movements in physical reality. Why? Because the physical ""player"" can be required to MOVE his/her body in order to move their virtual body....

The problem? Well, the virtual reality simulations may eventually end up *dictating* a physical player's movements to such a specific degree, that the physical player's are fixed TO that VR simulation, predicated upon the rules of the VR. In other words, whereby the virtual reality simulation dictates MORE of physical players movements, than the physical player can dictate his or herself.

Instead, this is simply a bringing forth the discussing of these possible implications of the usage of VR technology so that we may discuss how of future of VR can be utilized for our advantage rather than our disadvantage.

Checks on goods from NI reaching the UK will then be done at ports/airports. If they come from NI, no tariffs, if they come from the EU, apply tariffs.

The main negative (of which I'm aware) will be that NI British citizens will have to show passports to get to the rest of the UK. However, this is mainly a problem for Unionists, who number about 1 million, and in my opinion, a small price to pay for sorting out Brexit.

&amp;#x200B;

Why has this option been largely ignored so far? Probably because the Democratic Unionist Party has been propping up the government. Also people believe it will make NI more separate from the UK - this is already a region so separate it bans gay marriage.

Call me a gatekeeper, but I haven't seen anyone who actually understands programming getting mad about this. 

Here are some of the common arguments I've heard about how Game Freak supposedly has no excuse not to include every Pokémon, and why I believe they're wrong:

&gt;But the models created for X and Y were specifically designed to be future-proof! Can't they just import those?

Nothing in game development is ever that easy. Models also have to be rigged and animated, and probably more. Since Pokémon will appear in the overworld in the Wild Areas, each individual Pokémon will probably also have to have its own AI behaviors. I can't even imagine what else the developers may have to do.

&gt;Every other game had every generation of Pokémon!

Sword and Shield appear to be much bigger than previous generations. The previous games were designed for portable systems, but Sword and Shield were designed for a home console. 

&gt;You're acting like Game Freak is a small indie studio.

Compared to other companies, it is. The Witcher 3's production *started* with more people than Game Freak has in total. Every Ubisoft game has a large multinational production team, sometimes containing thousands of people. Zelda: Breath of the Wild had 300 names in the credits. 

&gt;The 3DS could handle 800+ Pokémon, so why can't the Switch?

The 3DS was a portable system with a 240p screen. The Switch is a home console that can display up to 1080p. The Pokémon aren't the only models in the game, and making HD models is much harder than making SD models. Countless game studios didn't survive the PS360 era because the shift to HD was too much of a jump.

&gt;But what about Masahiro Sakurai and his dedication?

Sakurai almost killed himself working on Super Smash Bros. for 3DS and Wii U. I don't like throwing this word around, but it's pretty entitled to believe someone should push themselves to their breaking point 24/7 just so you can use your Garbodor.

&gt;Couldn't they just delay the game?

Recently I find myself quite tired about school, I feel like I would be better at home playing games.

Prepare your seats, this is going to be a helluva trip.

The problem with school is that some people delay others, and others get delayed by some.

At a glance, this sounds like your average teenager complaint, well, at the end this could be the case, but I think I have enough arguments to sustain my point.

I still don't know how to write a proper argumentative text, so I'll just write counter arguments.

""If you don't go to school you're going to be dumb!"": 60 minutes watching YouTube teach me more than a full day at school (actually 6 hours), not useless fun facts, but real knowledge. A few years ago I spent the whole day watching video classes of mathematics, ever since then I've only been taught repeated topics.

""If you don't finish highschool, you won't get a job"": I could just do an exam, one which would award me with a highschool diploma.

""Highschool is the place for socializing, you'll get to know more people and create connections"": I've only meet one person that I found helpful professionally, my classmates are a pain, my teachers passively support their dumbness, like chatting about a famous person or whatever, instead of actually teaching useful stuff, I don't want to be near them. Also, I'm a loner, I can't start a conversation, I always react awkwardly.

""Treasure your teachers, a crappy virtual teacher could never match the real one"": Let's say the real teacher is TV, and the virtual is Internet, on TV they fill up the programation with nonsense to reach the time quota, such as copying a random useless text, on Internet I can go straight into what I want, whenever I want. The problem is that I don't know what to study next.

""So, your big plan is to quit school and stick your lazy ass to your PC all day? Which actually doesn't belong to you, but to your parents"": If I end up quitting, I'll work, because otherwise I would fall into the NEET world, I'll use the money to boost up my studies. I know having a job isn't an easy task, also I am really lazy, but I can do it if I need to. If everything goes well, by October I'll have the chance to work at my local bank.

My problem could be solved by finding a school/class where I could rely on my classmates to reach a new level of knowledge, cool people.

I want to study in USA, because oh great America, but my family doesn't have money for that, and my English isn't the best.

I want to study in Japan, because anime and tech stuff, but again, no money and almost zero japanese proficiency.

My hobbies: Anime, games, piano, playing with cats/dogs, learning english and japanese.
My grades: Usually A.
My personality: Not sure, but I certainly am worst than my self image. I might be a *little* egocentric.

By my understanding this is a one-off debt cancellation and then moving to make public 2 and 4 year universities free.

I had about $20k in loans and my divorced parents each took on a similar loans.  I also made sacrifices to pay off my debt and not accrue any more.

I feel that just cancelling all the debt will lead to endless talking points on the right how it benefited 'undeserving' person X while it didn't help person Y.

Government buy back off all debt and stop it from accruing interest? Great.  Making state universities free and overall funding them better?  Fantastic.  I just can't get behind cancelling the debt, and it reeks to me of trying to buy millennial votes. There are much better places that money could be going to.  Hell, I also have no medical debt but really wouldn't be opposed to just cancelling all medical debt in the US since by and large that's something people don't have any control over and only have that debt because the American healthcare industry has failed them.

Everyone should always vote. I really don't care what kind of election it is or who is running, but your vote should always be submitted and counted. However, many people see voting between multiple ""bad"" choices as a futile effort and choose not to vote at all. I believe a Negative vote option would eliminate this mindset.

If only 2 people are running in the election, one could argue that a vote for A is a vote against B. But (as is usually the case) when there are more than 2 people and you do not want to vote for A, having only the option of voting *for* B or C (if you dont really like them either) adds disincentive to vote. But if you know you have the option of a ""Negative A"" vote, then you can still make your strongest opinion known that you dont want A and that B or C is more preferable but you dont really care between them that much.

A difficulty of this system is that counting could take longer if the ballots must be counted by hand. However, many systems are available that would allow for automatic counting to not take any longer (i.e. all you would need is a bubble to fill in that says ""NEGATIVE VOTE"" above or near each name). I do not want to hear that this would be confusing. It could be made confusing if that was the intent, but a ballot that is:

&gt; Name(Party)         Vote For[]             Vote Against[]

Is not confusing (and if it is, then there are bigger issues besides a negative voting system). 

The best counterpoint I can think of is that rank choice voting allows you to rank your preferred options, but they are still votes *for* someone in the end. If you are in a position where the options do not instill any confidence, RCV doesnt help you; all it does is allow you to rank your options from ""dont care"" to ""dont want"". But Negative voting can also be used in RCV as long as the whole ballot is a negative vote (i.e. you would rank them from ""dont want"" to ""dont care"" so that your negative vote applies just like someone elses positive vote). I do not advocate for a system that merges RCV positive and RCV negative votes; either the whole ballot is votes for OR votes against.

Theoretically, this could lead to a situation where all participants garner negative votes, but I feel that more people would still prefer to vote for somebody as opposed to against someone and so the chances of this are very slim. A negative vote option could help the minority of people who feel their vote *for* someone is unimportant that their negative vote would have more of an impact.

So let me know what you think: should a democracy allow for a ""negative vote""? Would a ""negative vote"" severely impact the structure, function, and form of a democracy? Is giving a ""negative vote"" a logical conclusion in a democracy for total fairness (i.e. I can *vote for* or *not vote* or *spoil ballot*, but why should ""vote against"" be excluded from my options?)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is something I have been thinking about and I havent been able to find a significant or dangerous flaw so I figured Id open it to some fresh eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

**EDIT:**

Thank you to [zobotsHS](https://www.reddit.com/user/zobotsHS/) and  [Ansuz07](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ansuz07/) for changing my view.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a similar way that Murder includes Assault, Obstruction includes Collusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRST LET&amp;#39;S DEFINE OUR TERMS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.merriam-webster.com/legal/obstruction%20of%20justice""&gt;Legal Definition of Obstruction of Justice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;: the crime or act of willfully interfering with the process of justice and law especially by influencing, threatening, harming, or impeding a witness, potential witness, juror, or judicial or legal officer or by furnishing false information in or otherwise impeding an investigation or legal process&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the defendant&amp;#39;s obstruction of justice led to a more severe sentence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/collusion""&gt;Definition of Collusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;: secret agreement or cooperation especially for an illegal or deceitful purpose&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;acting in collusion with the enemy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cooperation""&gt;Definition of Cooperation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 : the actions of someone who is being helpful by doing what is wanted or asked for : common effort&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are asking for your full cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THEN LET&amp;#39;S MAKE SOME COMMON SENSE GENERALIZATIONS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PEOPLE WHO COMMIT CRIMES WANT TO GET AWAY WITH THEIR CRIMES.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IF THEY DO NOT THINK THEY WILL BE PUNISHED, IT WILL BE EASIER TO COMMIT THOSE CRIMES.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOW LET&amp;#39;S APPLY WHAT WE LEARNED:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to construct a sentence using &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; the above Merriam Webster definitions, a name I selected &lt;strong&gt;randomly&lt;/strong&gt; and the preposition &amp;quot;&lt;a href=""https://www.lexico.com/en/grammar/prepositions""&gt;by&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donald&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;is being helpful by doing what is wanted&amp;quot; &amp;quot;for an illegal or deceitful purpose&amp;quot; &lt;strong&gt;by&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;willfully interfering with the process of justice and law&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In other words, Donald is COLLUDING because he is COOPERATING by OBSTRUCTING.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That appointment would've meant that there would've been 5 Democrat- vs 4 Republican-appointed Judges.

&amp;#x200B;

They didn't refuse the appointment for any other reason than that Obama appointed him and they felt they could get away with it, as McConnel basically admitted recently.

&amp;#x200B;

The result of this is that now we have 5 Republican-appointed and only 4 Democrat-appointed Justices.

&amp;#x200B;

As Republicans like to point out, this was perfectly legal according to the word of the law. But it was a naked power move that portrayed an unwillingness to play by the same rules.

&amp;#x200B;

Expanding the Supreme Court is also perfectly legal. It would also be a naked power move, but it would also be only aimed at correcting the behaviour of Republicans. Instead of upsetting the balance in the Democrats favour, it would merely restore it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now the reason it would have to be expanded by two instead of one is twofold:

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, 10 is an even number and so the court would be subject to ties.

&amp;#x200B;

More importantly though, even adding just one democrat-appointed Judge would only make the balance even again, 5v5. The Supreme Court should have a 5 to 4 majority in Democrat-appointed Justices. Since Gorsuch can't be fired, to have a majority, two justices would have to be appointed by democrats.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course this will not be popular with Fox News viewers etc, but these people will never vote for a democrat anyway, no matter how long they play by rules made up by Republicans.

I also support kids, trans or not, hormone blockers or not, wearing whatever the hell they want, using whatever pronouns they feel suits them, etc.

I also enjoy drag queens and their performances. They have an insane amount of talent and skill and as an artist myself I love watching anyone do something creative and challenge the established norms of mainstream anything. #teamyvie

However...I have always looked at child beauty pageants as exploitative, objectifying, and toxic. Not to mention tacky and just plain creepy. I think they encourage and impose traditional drugstore magazine rack beauty standards on children at a ridiculously early age, and it's pretty disgusting.

Then we get into the drag queens of the same age.

Drag shows, in my experience, are generally not for children (unless specifically designated otherwise like a family drag brunch or when a queen reads at a library or something).

I've been seeing the Sephora ad on my Hulu a lot recently where they specifically show a very young person (assuming AMAB based on the ad campaign itself, possible a cis boy who just wants to do drag) doing what appears to be arriving at a dressing room, putting make up on, a dress, a wig, and a tiara for a performance, and then dancing with adults in full drag.

I know kids might feel some gender dysphoria. I support and embrace that and want there to be acceptance of a path to happiness for them in the mainstream.

I know kids play dress up when they're little. I take no issue with that.

What I do take issue with is the performative aspect, parents allowing their kid to parade around and perform sexuality without the kid understanding the full context of what they're doing, much the same as pageant kids on Toddlers and Tiaras.

I can't help but feel that most games described as Action RPGS - Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Diablo, Breath of the Wild - don't deserve to be called RPGs at all.

If your game doesn't have a narrative, or genuine choices for the character to make, there's no more roleplaying involved than Call of Duty, or Tomb Raider. Changing equipment or choosing which powers or skills to level doesn't make something an RPG, because plenty of other genres let you do just that. Ditto with exploring a world or solving puzzles. MMORPGs are slightly different, as they allow social roleplaying.

I'm intrigued to play games in worlds that GRRM has built, but I'm unconvinced FromSoftware have ever made an actual RPG, despite the awards they've won. The Game of Thrones Telltale series is a great example of a game that genuinely encourages roleplaying, even if the control system is incomparably awful. You get to make actual decisions for the character that have moral weight and impact the world.

Admittedly, I've only played about 2 hours of Dark Souls II (not my idea of a good time), and precisely zero hours of Bloodborne, or any other FromSoftware games.

My view boils down to a few points, from those I feel most strongly about, to weakest:

1. Most high school teachers, specializing in a particular subject, are ill-equipped to handle social-emotional issues, **and trainings are inadequate for giving the teachers the skills necessary to deal with the complex stages of child and adolescent development. Attempting to help without these necessary skills risks further damaging the child's social-emotional state further. In other words, it's potentially damaging to the student.**

2. Training for how to spot and handle social-emotional issues places an unfair burden of responsibility and liability on the teacher. **It is unfair because a teacher should not shoulder the blame for having not identified, or reported a social-emotional issue they are not equipped to intervene into.**

3. Teachers should not be expected to make themselves available to, or support students outside of class time. Any teacher that does, should be adopting that responsibility by choice, rather than requirement by school or district policy. **Trainings , and additional one-on-one time outside of the school day eat into a teacher's non-working personal time, and should not be mandated.**

4. Academics, and academic success are largely the responsibility of the student, and their parents, **thus social emotional issues preventing students from achieving academic success should be addressed at home, or by school administrators rather than the teacher directly, and pro-actively.**

5. Having social-emotional support available to students within the school administration is adequate, without also burdening the faculty with similar responsibilities.

~~6. Students generally face enough social-emotional adversity to warrant some support, as I conceded above. However, allowing the students to become accustomed to constant support risks the student losing the ability to learn to take care of their own social-emotional health. In other words, some adversity, and some figuring-out-how-to-help-yourself is a good thing, especially since most of those resources won't be available in college or adulthood.~~

**I'm striking this point because it's not something I really believe, but more of a thought I had. It has been thoroughly debunked.**

To change my view, you would need to address all of the points above, as I believe any single one could stand on its own.

Thank you, CMV!

**Common arguments:**

&gt;It shouldn't but this does not excuse assholery and selfishness.

I understand that people want empathetic teachers, and I understand why it's beneficial. That's not what this CMV is about. I've attended all of the trainings, and stayed after school to support my students. I've made reports, and recommended students to counseling, and have been commended for my teaching style, and ability to reach students. I do all of it, though I don't believe it's my responsibility, largely because I'm often the only one in a student's life who can, as most teachers are. It *is* my responsibility, though it shouldn't be.

&gt;If you ignore your students actual life experience and think teaching is just being a fact dispenser, some students may learn but many will not. 

There is a massive gradient between being a fact dispenser, and caring/being responsible for the social-emotional well being of a child or adolescent. I am not a robot, and normal interactions require some empathy to at least ""recognize the starting perspective of one's students"", as /u/mfdandp eloquently put it.

&gt;Thank you, Senator.
&gt;As it relates to r/the_donald specifically, we watch them closely, and we do our best to hold them to the same standards and policies as we do all communities. Before we action any community, we also speak to moderators regarding rule breaking behaviors. To that end, we have removed a number of their moderators over the years for not moderating to our standards, and we wouldn’t hesitate to do this again, or take additional steps, should their behavior warrant it. While they can be offensive and antagonistic to the rest of Reddit, we have not found them to be in consistent violation of our content policies.

Really, you dont think that calling for political officials to arrested and lynched is against community standards. What about calling for the rape of activist. Or the burning of mosques. What about campaigning for the invasion of countries and the murder of millions of innocent civilians. What about the beating of transvestites or the shooting up of schools. How can you tell me that doesn't go against your content policies.

&gt;Yes, we do see individual posts and comments that cross the line, but the offending content also gets removed as we ask and expect, and we also take action against those individual users and accounts with suspensions or full bans from the site as appropriate.

These aren't individual post. This is literally what the community is dedicated too. And whatever action you guys are taking seems to be fairly ineffective.

&gt;I wish there was a solution that was as simple as banning the community—certainly it would make some things easier—but the reality is that banning a large political community that isn’t in violation of our policies would be hugely problematic, not just for Reddit, but for our democracy generally. Political speech is the most protected form of speech in the United States, and we are sensitive to that and take cues from the government when we think about our policies.

This isn't political activism, this is hate speech. The man who shot up a mosque in New Zealand, this is what he was looking at. The synagogue shooter, this is what he saw. How can a democracy, meant to protect the people allow this to happen.

&gt;I know this isn’t the answer many of you are looking for, but as we continue to deliberate and evolve our thinking, my hope is that you appreciate the complexity of this situation and understand our approach.

We appreciate that you put profits and ad revenue above the quality of your website and the health of society. You'd rather sit idly by and watch as young boys are alienated and turned into monsters.

Is there really wage stagnation?  I recall hearing that wages have actually been rising, it's just that the compensation has shifted towards benefits like retirement and healthcare.  But is wage growth, including benefit compensation, keeping up with costs of living?

What are the long-term concerns about widening income disparity?  If capital is reinvested to create market growth and jobs, does it matter if that capital is only being invested by very few people?  Is growing income disparity linked to wage stagnation?

Is the problem perhaps that the wealthy are spending more on luxury and less on capital investment?  If so, what are the long-term effects of increased luxury spending?  Aren't you still getting money back into the economy via the purchase of luxury commodities?

I am *anecdotally* certain that people can't actually live working full-time on minimum wage – at least not where I live, the numbers just don't add up.  I am all for raising the minimum wage, or perhaps even a UBI policy, but I am honestly not sure if either of these would have the desired effect.  The counter-argument that always comes up is that an artificial rise in consumer spending power would just result in a rise in living costs, bringing us back to square one.  Is this true?

What will the impact of increased automation be on the economy?  Will this happen gradually enough for the economy to naturally adjust on its own, or are we going to need social policies to help people who lose jobs or require higher education to stay employed?

 
Again, I am not looking to be shifted away from the left as I fundamentally believe that we should prioritize our concerns for the whole over the radical economic freedom of the individual.  But if it turns out that interventions in capitalism won't fix the problems we want fixed, I would want to shift my focus towards fixing the *psychology* that drives capitalism.  I worry that much of the left's desire for economic redistribution would never be satisfied, would never be *enough*, because it is a reaction to the obsession with material production inherent to capitalism.  We need to distinguish between who suffers *materially* under capitalism, from how we *all* suffer *psychologically* under capitalism.  Maybe there is a limit to redistribution, beyond which our struggle would be to free ourselves from the conflation of identity and productivity, our obsession with luxury as the sign of human value, the ethical compromises we make to maximize profit, etc.  If we can only safely alter the economic system so much, then we should start trying to shift our own subjective relationship *to* the economic system.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Pointing out that men have privileges as well will not change my view. I already accept and acknowledge the privileges men receive in American society just because they are men in other contexts.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I believe that each person should be aware of and acknowledge any privileges they were born with. Anyone can have privilege regardless of gender or race. Some will have a lot of privilege, others will have very little or none. Every individual being aware of their privileges is a positive for society.

&amp;#x200B;

\- This view however is more on the macro level. Generally speaking, women are more likely than men to have the majority of social power in dating/meeting contexts, just because they are women (I will explain how below)

&amp;#x200B;

\- My view has been formed from posts on /r/tinder, as well as the personal experience I had with dating apps.

&amp;#x200B;

\- My own personal experience: I spent 11 months on Tinder, Bumble, and Coffee Meets Bagel (am currently engaged). I am 40, am in excellent physical shape, and am objectively attractive (full head of hair and conventionally attractive facial features, well defined arms/chest/stomach, proper % of body fat, 6'0"" height). I met people from 36-45 years old. In this particular age group, I very much stand out among other men in that age group.

&amp;#x200B;

I only mention this to make the point that despite ""just being attractive"", I still saw the privilege that women have in this context. I acknowledge being attractive helps a lot, but it doesn't make the burdens men have disappear.

&amp;#x200B;

Explanation of female privilege in dating/meeting contexts:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Men are expected to make ""the first move"". They have to approach the woman, not knowing whether or not she likes him. The women has the option of accepting or rejecting the man. This gives women power.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Even on Bumble, where it is setup for women to make the first move, all they do is message ""hey"", ""hi"", ""sup?', etc... and then it is on the man to make the actual first move.

&amp;#x200B;

\- The man is expected to be clever and interesting or they will just get passed on for someone else. The woman can often just react to what the man does, and this is enough.

&amp;#x200B;

\- If a woman wants to make the actual first move, they have the option to do so. Few on society would look down on a woman for doing this. Men however, don't have the option of not making the first move.

&amp;#x200B;

\- On the first date, men have to assume they will be expected to pay 100% of any bills. In practice, I experienced about 50/48/2. Half the time the woman expected me to pay, almost half the time she expected to split the bills, and a few times she wanted to pay for both of us. However, a woman KNOWS the man will not expect her to pay for everything; The man does not know this.

&amp;#x200B;

\- One rarely sees videos/books about things like ""99 WAYS TO PICK UP WOMEN!"". There is a reason for this. Movies like Hitch, if it was a women playing Will Smith's character, and that character was helping women, would just be totally confusing to the audience and it wouldn't work. There is a reason for this.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I'm being hyperbolic here, but all an attractive woman has to do is just basically exist and be available, and they'll be able to pick up men. Even the most attractive man has to do much more than that.

&amp;#x200B;

\- In short, men have to work harder than women do to meet/date people. Men also are much more at risk of social rejection, which is very difficult for any man that has social anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be clear. This isn't an incel thing, and I don't despise women. And I know on that first meetup/date, the woman is just as nervous as the guy is. Also, dating was still super fun and I met a lot of awesome people (plus some very weird ones sometimes). I simply have a view on what I learned socially during the dating process, and am interested in discussing it and having it changed.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bullet points below in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only mention this to make the point that despite &amp;quot;just being attractive&amp;quot;, I still saw the privilege that women have in this context. I acknowledge being attractive helps a lot, but it doesn&amp;#39;t make the burdens men have disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explanation of female privilege in dating/meeting contexts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Men are expected to make &amp;quot;the first move&amp;quot;. They have to approach the woman, not knowing whether or not she likes him. The women has the option of accepting or rejecting the man. This gives women power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Even on Bumble, where it is setup for women to make the first move, all they do is message &amp;quot;hey&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;hi&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;sup?&amp;#39;, etc... and then it is on the man to make the actual first move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- The man is expected to be clever and interesting or they will just get passed on for someone else. The woman can often just react to what the man does, and this is enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- If a woman wants to make the actual first move, they have the option to do so. Few on society would look down on a woman for doing this. Men however, don&amp;#39;t have the option of not making the first move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- On the first date, men have to assume they will be expected to pay 100% of any bills. In practice, I experienced about 50/48/2. Half the time the woman expected me to pay, almost half the time she expected to split the bills, and a few times she wanted to pay for both of us. However, a woman KNOWS the man will not expect her to pay for everything; The man does not know this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- One rarely sees videos/books about things like &amp;quot;99 WAYS TO PICK UP WOMEN!&amp;quot;. There is a reason for this. Movies like Hitch, if it was a women playing Will Smith&amp;#39;s character, and that character was helping women, would just be totally confusing to the audience and it wouldn&amp;#39;t work. There is a reason for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- I&amp;#39;m being hyperbolic here, but all an attractive woman has to do is just basically exist and be available, and they&amp;#39;ll be able to pick up men. Even the most attractive man has to do much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- In short, men have to work harder than women do to meet/date people. Men also are much more at risk of social rejection, which is very difficult for any man that has social anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be clear. This isn&amp;#39;t an incel thing, and I don&amp;#39;t despise women. And I know on that first meetup/date, the woman is just as nervous as the guy is. Also, dating was still super fun and I met a lot of awesome people (plus some very weird ones sometimes). I simply have a view on what I learned socially during the dating process, and am interested in discussing it and having it changed.&lt;/p&gt;

There appears to be little controversy about this bill other than Congress slow action in extending it, passing it, or expanding it. 

First responders and other victims of 9/11 absolutely deserve support from the government. 9/11 first responders are incredibly brave for what they did and the post-attack search and cleanups were also huge undertakings and I can only imagine the physical and emotional toll they took.

But I don't see why someone involved in 9/11 deserves any more support from a first responder in any other situation. Why should a first responder to 9/11 get preferential treatment to a responder to something like a fire or hurricane? I have little doubt first responders around the country would have responded similarly to 9/11 as NY first responders. And I have no doubt they similarly respond to emergencies on a daily basis - albeit on a smaller scale - with virtually no national or congressional attention. 

It seems to me the main reason is simply the patriotic and nationalistic nostalgia related to 9/11.

Hopefully this isn’t found to be too offensive or anything.

As long as mutual informed consent from all relevant parties is provided, we should not be able to judge, oppress, or discriminate against people just because they have a different sexual preference to you. I’ll provide a few examples which I have no problem with, assuming proper precautions and protection are taken:

&amp;nbsp;

Homosexuality – I don’t think I need to add anything for this

Incest – as long as there are no resulting offspring that may have birth defects

Sex with inanimate Objects (cars, trains, whatever) – as long as it’s owned by that individual

Beastiality – If done at the volition of the animal, therefore highly unlikely for it to be possible for the human to engage in penetration. Bestiality should be classed as animal cruelty rather than its own distinct category when it comes to legal decisions.

Necrophilia **(conceded)**– If clearly specified in the will of the deceased.

Paedophilia **(removed)** – Although I do accept that it is almost impossible to demonstrate informed consent from a child below the age of around 15 (so more like ephebophilia I guess). There are some arguments about grooming etc, but I’m not convinced that a child who has been groomed would be adequately displaying informed consent. Probably the hardest act to justify, simply because the concept of informed consent is very difficult to apply to minors.

&amp;nbsp;

I feel that a lot of arguments that denounce the above acts are not consistent with current accepted practices. For example, the argument that being more lenient on paedophilia will lead to more child rape does not have any proof that I’m aware of. Additionally, that seems to be like saying we should ban alcohol because allowing alcohol consumption leads to more alcohol abuse.

Secondly, even if there is proof that these acts may result in long term mental damage (none that I’m aware of), people are allowed to make mistakes, and have to live with the consequences. We’re not allowed to physically prevent people from getting into toxic relationships just because we think it will cause them long term emotional distress. Additionally, any long term damage that I think might come from these acts would mainly be due to rejection from society, for no good reason besides cultural bias.

This is my first post, so happy to accept any constructive feedback regarding the structure of my argument.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: I will remove paedophilia from my OP. This is because despite highlighting that I acknowledge that a child cannot give informed consent, and that grooming affects the ability of an individual to provide consent, the majority of the comments below are either regarding informed consent of a child, or the effects of grooming.

It may seem counter intuitive but here is the thing...there is a massive power imbalance between a car or a person on a bike, scooter, or skateboard &amp;amp; blind spots / hard to see spots are a thing when you are traveling in the same direction.

When I lived in Washington DC biking was my primary mode of transportation &amp;amp; there are a lot of bike lanes. However I generally rode my bike on the road because inside the city I could keep up with the flow of traffic and I felt much safer occupying a visible place in the traffic pattern than I did in the bike lane next to it.

Out in Long Beach I skate board around a lot and typically do so in the bike lane going the wrong direction. In this way I have a clear view of any hazards coming in my direction and I am approaching turning vehicles from a direction they would be looking while deciding if it is a safe moment for them to proceed with the turn. Similarly when traveling on one way streets with no bike lanes (which there are a lot of in LB) I always travel against the flow of traffic so that I can see motorists and they can see me &amp;amp; know I see them. It feels dramatically safer yet still I see most people sticking to the herd mentality on these streets and going in the same direction as motorists...are our urban planners failing us miserably or is there some strong bit of logic i am failing to consider?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPINION CHANGED: greater speed / impact in inevitable collisions as presented by many below, makes sense as a good reason for parallel flow.

However I generally rode my bike on the road because inside the city I could keep up with the flow of traffic and I felt much safer occupying a visible place in the traffic pattern than I did in the bike lane next to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out in Long Beach I skate board around a lot and typically do so in the bike lane going the wrong direction. In this way I have a clear view of any hazards coming in my direction and I am approaching turning vehicles from a direction they would be looking while deciding if it is a safe moment for them to proceed with the turn. Similarly when traveling on one way streets with no bike lanes (which there are a lot of in LB) I always travel against the flow of traffic so that I can see motorists and they can see me &amp;amp; know I see them. It feels dramatically safer yet still I see most people sticking to the herd mentality on these streets and going in the same direction as motorists...are our urban planners failing us miserably or is there some strong bit of logic i am failing to consider?&lt;/p&gt;

Full stop. Outward appearance and secondary characteristics can indeed be altered to resemble the opposite sex, but a male person cannot BECOME female and visa-versa. 

People who have a single X and Y chromosome are biologically male. In society they can identify and be recognized as women, but they are not and never will be female (XX). Obviously, the inverse is true as well. Unfortunately to the dismay of some, no medical treatment or operation can change this reality.

Thus, since nobody can transition from Male-to-Female or from Female-to-Male, the abbreviations MtF and FtM cannot logically be reconciled in a biological context. If such phrases are actually used in reference to gender identity instead of biology, then why are biological terms (male and female) being used at all? In fact, they shouldn’t be and cannot (rationally) be used by anyone who also maintains the sex-gender distinction. 

While I can understand the term ‘trans woman’ in the context of gender identity, the same cannot be said for the term ‘trans female’, which I have regularly seen used interchangeably with the former. If female can be used interchangeably with woman and male interchangeably with man, then the terms are synonymous and the sex-gender distinction loses all coherence.
Moreover, notice how people only ever say ‘gender identity’, not ‘sex identity’. This is undoubtedly due to the common idea of there being a fundamental difference between gender and sex.

If the trans community wishes to uphold and assert the sex-gender distinction, then they ought to repudiate the use of the terms and phrases ‘trans male’, ‘trans female’, ‘male-to-female’ (MtF), and ‘female-to-male’ (FtM), and exclusively adhere to ‘man’ and ‘woman’ instead of ‘male’ and ‘female’ respectively.

Practically speaking, if a transwoman were to request that I use her preferred pronouns, then without question, I would comply. In most cases I imagine this will suffice. However, if a transwoman were to phrase things in such a way that would require me to recognize her as explicitly as female, I would be unable to so.

&amp;#x200B;

in 1647 two employees of the Dutch East India company shipwrecked in South Africa and were able to survive thanks to the help of South African natives. When the sailors returned to Holland they brought stories of South Africa's fertile and beautiful landscape, and remarked that due to it's position on the southern most tip of Africa the country could serve as a ""warehouse and garden"" for traders looking to take respite on their way from Europe to Asia. The Dutch soon began colonize South Africa. Dutch semi nomadic settlers known as Boers (the dutch word for farmer) initially began colonizing South Africa, often fighting bloody conflicts with local Xhosa tribes. 

&amp;#x200B;

In 1806, after the Napoleonic wars, the British were ceded control of South Africa, and in 1820 British began heavily colonizing South Africa in numbers never before reached by the Dutch. Then in 1867 the British discovered diamonds in South Africa, and things got much worse. South African native Zulus made a push for freedom with the Anglo-Zulu war in 1879 but were defeated by the British. In 1913 the British passed the Natives' Land Act, which restricted land ownership by native South Africans.

&amp;#x200B;

In 1948 the National Party of South Africa  instituted Apartheid, which defined three distinct races, blacks, coloureds, and whites. Under Apartheid marriage was restricted across racial lines, the majority blacks were removed from their homes and forced to live in specially designated areas in which conditions were brutal. Employment and land ownership was restricted for majority blacks in South Africa.  Whites in South Africa enjoyed the best living conditions in all of Africa and prospered immensely off of South Africa's rich lands and mineral deposits. Apartheid laws were not removed until the early 1990s.

&amp;#x200B;

Today South Africa is home to some of the largest and poorest slums in the world. Informal segregation is still alive and well in South Africa's ""townships"" which are essentially enormous sprawling cities populated by South African blacks living in intense poverty with little to no fresh water or other basic amenities. These townships, which on some cases can be home to millions, are often positioned directly across from South African vineyards and farmland, which not only serve to make their white owners rich, but use a drastically disproportionate amount of water and resources. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My Philosophy in Context**

&amp;#x200B;

It is clear upon examination of the history and current state of affairs in South Africa, that  historically, black people have been systematically taken advantage of by white people. It also clear that currently, modern day white people are profiting off of this historical injustice and modern day black people are suffering for it.

&amp;#x200B;

I also acknowledge that the white people profiting did not commit the injustices that allowed them to succeed. I acknowledge that it is wrong to make a person pay for crimes they did not commit.

&amp;#x200B;

I acknowledge that a strong argument against land redistribution is that white farmers should not be penalized for the sins of their ancestors. However, there is a simple response to this argument. Just as white farmers should not be penalized for the sins of their forefathers, they should not be allowed to profit off them either. 

&amp;#x200B;

I acknowledge that I do not possess a strong enough understanding of the South Africa economy to provide a concrete plan with specifics on how exactly land should be redistributed, but I don't want these details to be the focus of this argument. I am arguing philosophically for the idea that it is unfair for South African white to continue to profit off the vestiges of Apartheid while the blacks suffer under it. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the case of South Africa, after decades of egregious mistreatment of Blacks, leading to intensely unequal conditions, I feel that redistribution of land is not over-correction, but retribution.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South African History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Philosophy in Context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear upon examination of the history and current state of affairs in South Africa, that  historically, black people have been systematically taken advantage of by white people. It also clear that currently, modern day white people are profiting off of this historical injustice and modern day black people are suffering for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also acknowledge that the white people profiting did not commit the injustices that allowed them to succeed. I acknowledge that it is wrong to make a person pay for crimes they did not commit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I acknowledge that a strong argument against land redistribution is that white farmers should not be penalized for the sins of their ancestors. However, there is a simple response to this argument. Just as white farmers should not be penalized for the sins of their forefathers, they should not be allowed to profit off them either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I acknowledge that I do not possess a strong enough understanding of the South Africa economy to provide a concrete plan with specifics on how exactly land should be redistributed, but I don&amp;#39;t want these details to be the focus of this argument. I am arguing philosophically for the idea that it is unfair for South African white to continue to profit off the vestiges of Apartheid while the blacks suffer under it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of South Africa, after decades of egregious mistreatment of Blacks, leading to intensely unequal conditions, I feel that redistribution of land is not over-correction, but retribution.&lt;/p&gt;

Ethics is a complex area of philosophy. I have seen various attempts to create a taxonomy — my favorite uses three broad categories: Consequential, Duty, and Virtue.

Consequential models are grounded in maximizing good, Duty models are grounded in the *intention* portending action, and Virtue models are grounded in values we should curate and develop within ourselves: our character.

That said, I do not believe that these models are mutually exclusive. ~~Quite the contrary they are interdependent  related.~~ Each posits an important question that ~~is foundational to~~  must be considered in any ethical framework (independent of which may be seen as primary).  This table clearly demonstrates the difference:

|**Example Question**|Is ""good"" objective or subjective?|Why is lying bad?|Should I lie to my terminally ill grandmother about how long she has to live?|

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I would like to state my personal belief in pluralism and pragmatism.

Pluralism, which is contrasted by relativism, is the idea that there are objective truths beyond what we currently know, or even can know. As such, it is expected that there will be many ostensibly competing views, which actually all relate to, or imply, a single monastic/objective truth. The classic example of this is the ancient Buddhist parable of the blind men and the elephant:

&gt;Three blind men encounter an elephant.  Each must determine its form through touch alone.  In doing so each comes away with a different idea of what an elephant is.  One thinks it has a body like a snake, another thinks it is round and firm like a tree trunk, and the last is positive it is more like a large smooth leaf that flaps about.

Knowing an elephant's true form, you can easily ascertain that each blind man has one piece of the puzzle and that none are wrong.   Not knowing this, the men argue, and come to blows.  Each was sure that their interpretation was the right one.

The ensuing fight reveals these men as relativists, a pragmatist would have accepted each view as a part of a greater truth.  Relativism inhibits progress by excluding the possibility of independent objectivity.

Next, Pragmatism, it is predicated on [Fallibilism](https://www.iep.utm.edu/fallibil/) (the idea that knowing is a matter a degrees, and that nothing is 100% certain).  To a pragmatist all knowledge is imperfect —  flawed.   As such, truth only exists in the moment — truth is judged by its present utility (how well it works for us in the here and now).  It  can only be ascertained by engaging with society, the world, and ourselves.  It is an ongoing project, a verb — knowing is a journey not a destination.

&amp;#x200B;

**Onto my premise:**

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that objectivity is relative to an observer, society/ecology, and subject, and that each is in a constant state of flux.  A mountain is only still in our reference frame, in geological time, it is alive, like a wave on an ocean. As such, something can only be objectively true in so far as we are able to keep up with and understand this change.

Human beings have a moral obligation to curate a virtue of inquiry, have a duty to act on what they learn from that inquiry, and should ensure their actions maximize the good as it is presently understood.  This mandates that they engage with the world as best they are able.  If they withdraw, and rest on their laurels, they are acting immorally.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is an interesting example:

If you were to find a wallet in a grocery store what would be the ethical response:

**A) Leave it alone.**

**B) Give it to the store manager.**

**C) Keep it.**

In order to answer this question we must consider the context.  If you are an elderly white women living in an gentrified largely white area the correct answer may be to give it to the store manager.  However, if you are a young black man living in a community with a known history of racial bias the correct answer may be to leave it alone.  Taking it to the manager might pose a greater risk to your own wellbeing, and that of your family — you may be blamed for something.

&amp;#x200B;

So, does the answer to this ethical question have multiple answers, is it relativistic, or something else?  The only way to know the answer, to the best of our ability, is to have an **up to date** model of yourself, the ecology (society/world) around you, and the issue in question.

&amp;#x200B;

The young black man would be acting ethically by leaving the wallet alone if he had done his due diligence and knew, with a reasonable degree of confidence, that there was racial bias present in his community.  However, if that that young black man were to move to another community/country he would be duty bound to engage with that community and understand himself in the context of it to the ***best of his ability***.  Making the same assumption elsewhere (or even in the same place at another time) would be immoral.

Objective morality is not relative to the individual, it is pluralistic among individuals, but the implied monisistic truth behind the pluralism is relative to a context/ecology that is in flux.  This temporality — ever changing nature — demands that we engage with, and attempt to understand, our world.

&amp;#x200B;

**Knowledge is a faculty of moral  judgment — not maintaining it to the best of ones abilities is immoral.**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off, of I would like to preface this by stating that I am not a zealot — I just have an intuition that  something is here.

I don't hold anything against sex workers. I don't think they have less inherent worth as a human being.

Onto my explanation...

In the past week or so, I have done some digging on my own instead of taking the mainstream medias word on it. I have found some interesting pieces of data that is leading me to believe that the earths temperature is on trend just as it has been for the past hundreds of thousands of years.

See the following two links, which both show the same thing essentially:

As you can see, both of these links plot the earths temperature and CO2 levels over the past 400,000 years. As you can also see, the trend we are currently on seems to match up with what previous trends have been. I do not see anything abnormal about our current trend compared to the trends that have been present over the past 400,000 years.

Am I going crazy or something? The issue I have is, the charts people show me that supposedly prove climate is change is real are typically of the past 1,000 or 2,000 years. That does not mean much to me - I want to compare our current trend to trends that date as far back as possible. I want to ""zoom out"", if you will, to get the full picture.

That is my personal position on the issue.


Here comes the BUT...


The climate change debate is too often getting twisted into an anti-humanist one and ultimately a nihilistic one.
Basically, that human existence is the issue, not an issue with resource usage or allocation. 


This is characterized in two main ways. An argument that heavily, implies that humanity doesn't deserve
to exist. That humanity might even be morally reprehensible. And the second is that the only way to really change human behavior is by force and authoritarian means.


I will try to present these arguments in the form that I have seen them, and then offer up my rebuttal.


The first argument often made is that there is a clear distinction made between the planet
and human beings as a whole. 

This often leads to the conclusion that humans are like a virus that is infecting the Earth.
Or that Earth is a separate entity with it's own agency that has a goal to maintain some perceived natural purity. 

This to me can only really be interpreted as a nihilistic argument. It's fundamentally incorrect. Earth is a complex system in which
humans are inherently a part of. They are not separate. Most worrisome though is that implies that the earth is against us. Or even that
earth has the means to be for or against something. That it has goals that are in direct conflict with human kind. (I refer you to George Carlin bit on saving the planet as a funny take of this argument).
It is an anti human and pro earth argument. Even though the very concept of being pro earth is bizarre.

The second is that overpopulation is the primary issue. This argument has merits, since more people obviously
equates to more resource consumption. However, the implied solution to the issue is problematic.
We must depopulate. How do you do this? Well this argument often leads to the final argument.

The final argument that human society is the issue. Now this is obviously a nuanced argument which has a lot of truth to it.
However, the nihilistic and anti humanist position is that human behavior must change, but this change must be done by force or authoritarian means.
Fundamentally, they do not believe human's ability to change via their own volition.

Don't get me wrong, on bad days I can see how they reach this conclusion. But it's lazy and historically shown to be dangerous.
My gut response to this is that if humanity has to be saved by removing essentially what it is that makes us human, our own agency, then we haven't really saved anyone.

It's clear to me that if the climate change argument is presented as the points above, someone hearing the climate change debate for the first time will have a strong incentive to turn away and dismiss it.
Accepting it means accepting that humanity doesn't deserve to live on earth, and that the only solution is to actually take away the very thing that makes us human.

I understand these views are radical and are presented by a minority, but it is often the radical, minority position you hear first on a topic you don't know much about. This argument will push many people way simply on principle.

None of this is a justification for remaining scientifically illiterate or ignoring the effects of man made climate change.

I want finish my argument by making a case for humanity and that essentially we have only known about our wide scale effect on the climate for the last 60 - 70 years. That is such a short blip of time. 
Just think about the progress we've made in that time and then compare that to the magnitude of the problem.
The problem involves fundamentally changing industries, markets, and the minds of billions of people about our effect on an insanely complex ecological system. The complexity in that is staggering. And all of this has to be done without collapsing the very fragile system we live in.

And yeah, maybe we aren't exactly where we need to be and that there has been setbacks, and we could be doing better, but we have to remember that humans never intentionally did this. Nobody knew about the effects we would have on the global climate when they started burning coal. It is, at its core, a blameless problem, and we have to be careful we don't actually blame the concept of humanity itself.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to preface this by saying that I believe that humans are accelerating climate change
via the use of fossil fuels. This will ultimately be detrimental and cause huge issues in the near future.
That is my personal position on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here comes the BUT...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The climate change debate is too often getting twisted into an anti-humanist one and ultimately a nihilistic one.
Basically, that human existence is the issue, not an issue with resource usage or allocation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is characterized in two main ways. An argument that heavily, implies that humanity doesn&amp;#39;t deserve
to exist. That humanity might even be morally reprehensible. And the second is that the only way to really change human behavior is by force and authoritarian means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will try to present these arguments in the form that I have seen them, and then offer up my rebuttal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first argument often made is that there is a clear distinction made between the planet
and human beings as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This often leads to the conclusion that humans are like a virus that is infecting the Earth.
Or that Earth is a separate entity with it&amp;#39;s own agency that has a goal to maintain some perceived natural purity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This to me can only really be interpreted as a nihilistic argument. It&amp;#39;s fundamentally incorrect. Earth is a complex system in which

**Brief summary of arguments:** 

1. E3 2019 already shows a significant decrease in publisher participation (Sony not doing a press conference)
2. This year has seen an unprecedented amount of leaks in the days/weeks leading up to E3. Publishers want to show off their product in the best light to get the best first impression possible. That's harder if they're making a big E3 showcase which gets leaked days beforehand.
3. Publishers do not need to actually attend E3 to get their stuff announced. Sony has been peppering announcements in the last few weeks, notably Death Stranding and PS5 hints. 
4. Because of 2.) and 3.), it is getting harder and harder to justify spending what I assume are mass amounts of marketing dollars to put together a presentation for games.
5. (Low Confidence) E3 seems to put pressure on big publishers to fill in a 1.5 hour timeslot. This leads to a lot of content that most E3-attending-gamers are not likely to care about. In mind, I have Bethesda's emphasis on mobile gaming.

The greenhouse effect would heat the Earth up on average, and cause the polar ice caps to melt, leading to the release of further greenhouse gases and the rising of the oceans.

I like kids alright, I have some nephews and a niece on the way and I like seeing them. Could I be around them every day though? No. Never in a million years could I handle raising these children. I would go insane. Babysitting them even for a day drives me crazy. In fact, any time I ever watch somebody’s kids, it makes me remember why I don’t want them. 

When you have kids you are making a lifelong commitment. There isn’t really a perfect age to even have kids, IMO. If you have them when you’re young, then you won’t be able to have a real life, or time to yourself again until you’re too old to even want it. Who wants to travel the world and do fun things when you’re 40? If you have kids and still do things, you still have to cater to the kid 24/7. Who wants to hear a screaming toddler while you’re on vacation? Then, if you have kids when you’re older, you’re stuck raising them for basically the rest of your remaining youth. Have kids at 30, stuck until at least 48. Who wants to still be raising kids in their late 40’s? 

As babies, children cry and keep you up all night. Say goodbye to sleep, privacy, and personal time/space. They make messes. Let’s not get started on the disgusting diapers, and diaper blowouts. Why would anyone willingly sign up for that. You constantly have to watch them to make sure they don’t do anything wrong or get hurt. In their teens, they stress you out. They cost money. Nothing is ever about you once you have kids. The dedicated parents have kids, go to work to support them, (half the time they don’t even appreciate it) and get stuck in a boring loop for 18 years. That seems so miserable to me, the idea of just simply settling because of your kids. 

I can not understand how ANY of the pros outweigh all the cons. What, you do all of this to get some sweet baby cuddles every once in a while, or hear them say, “i love you?” Do people do it to have someone to take care of them when they’re older? People always want kids when they find someone they love. Do they  need a living thing that’s half them and half their partner to validate their relationship, or make them happy? Kids are usually great when they’re grown. Families can do lots of things together, make memories— I get that. I also understand having kids to carry on your legacy or whatever, I just don’t think that going through all that is worth it. 

I don’t know. Change my view!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been exploring the idea of being childfree. I like kids alright, I have some nephews and a niece on the way and I like seeing them. Could I be around them every day though? No. Never in a million years could I handle raising these children. I would go insane. Babysitting them even for a day drives me crazy. In fact, any time I ever watch somebody’s kids, it makes me remember why I don’t want them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have kids you are making a lifelong commitment. There isn’t really a perfect age to even have kids, IMO. If you have them when you’re young, then you won’t be able to have a real life, or time to yourself again until you’re too old to even want it. Who wants to travel the world and do fun things when you’re 40? If you have kids and still do things, you still have to cater to the kid 24/7. Who wants to hear a screaming toddler while you’re on vacation? Then, if you have kids when you’re older, you’re stuck raising them for basically the rest of your remaining youth. Have kids at 30, stuck until at least 48. Who wants to still be raising kids in their late 40’s? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As babies, children cry and keep you up all night. Say goodbye to sleep, privacy, and personal time/space. They make messes. Let’s not get started on the disgusting diapers, and diaper blowouts. Why would anyone willingly sign up for that. You constantly have to watch them to make sure they don’t do anything wrong or get hurt. In their teens, they stress you out. They cost money. Nothing is ever about you once you have kids. The dedicated parents have kids, go to work to support them, (half the time they don’t even appreciate it) and get stuck in a boring loop for 18 years. That seems so miserable to me, the idea of just simply settling because of your kids. &lt;/p&gt;

So I didn’t change my mind but I did find that I needed to make an adjustment to one of my conditions. The condition needs to be that the pet I adopt must have been facing absolute certain death prior to me adopting it. That way I am not taking away his chance, even if just a small chance, at a longer and happier life. 

Results:          
So today I went to the pound and asked to see the dogs on death row. They took me to see a pretty little white and brown dog with sad eyes and told me she was next to go. I asked if I could watch her be put down. They said no so I offered to donate $200 to the shelter if they let me watch. The vet said ok and we went into the killing room. I watched quietly as the vet filled the syringe with the poison. I inched closer as the needle came near the dogs skin. I saw a drop of the crystal clear liquid tremble on the tip of the needle and held my breath. When the needle pierced the skin and the dog let out a small Yelp. I yelled “STOP!” 

The vet stopped. I looked him in the eyes and said, “her life belongs to me now。please let me have that syringe.” He said I couldn’t have the syringe because it was illegal. I said, “but I need it for the painless death.” He started moving towards the door so I grabbed the syringe out of his hand. “I want to adopt this dog” I said. The vet said he would be right back. He hurried outside and I could feel that he was going to call the police. I picked up the dog and ran, syringe in hand, out of the building. 

The dog was scared so I held it close and gave it comfort. Comfort and love it would never have had. A security guard was chasing us. I ran but the dog slowed me down. I can’t go to jail, I thought. I can’t keep you, dog. But I can’t let you go either. They’ll kill you.      No... I’ll kill you...  

I stopped down and stroked the dog. I told it I loved it and that it was my best friend. I hugged it. And then I plunged the needle into its skin and pushed the plunger. 

I don’t think she felt it. Or if she did I dont think she knew what it was. I held her as she faded away. When she was gone I fled too. I know I did the right thing today. I only regret that I wasn’t able to give her more time. I hope those 5 minutes were the best of her life.

I know that there has been a lot of conflict in terms of banning single-use plastic bags. The basis of the argument is that by banning single-use bags, it will force people to buy reusable bags. As a result of these reusable bags, there will just be additional waste by producing these products.

I feel like, with few exceptions there's no such thing as ""Age appropriate content."" I think that if a child has a want to watch or play (I.E. Video games) something, they should be allowed to.

I would consider sexual content to be the only caveat, and that's specifically because even if a child wants to watch porn doing so before say puberty or a desire for the opposite sex even could have some almost abuse like effects. Even then, I think that porn is fine during/after puberty but before 18/21 Also, I want to be clear that non-sexual nude scenes are fine (I.E. discussions in say Game of Thrones, that happen in a Brothel etc.)

As a final disclaimer I don't advocate torturing children by forcing them to consume media that they don't desire to watch. I have heard of some parents that will force horror movies on children when it makes them uncomfortable or things like that. I'm strictly talking about a child expressing their own desire to consume media. If they are comfortable watching said horror movie and won't get nightmares or anything I don't think there is a problem.


Now onto my actual argument. With consideration for the above, I don't think its bad parenting to let your kids watch or enjoy things. In fact, I think the earlier that kids are exposed to complex narratives the better. I believe that it fosters a curiosity in learning through a desire to understand the media consumed. I think that in turn fosters critical thinking skills at an earlier age and develops lifelong articulation skills and vocabulary.

I say this as someone who was allowed to watch or play whatever I wanted growing up. My fondest memories are things like Godzilla, or Bio Booster Armor Guyver (Which is far more violent than age appropriate american TV.) Both of which I watched regularly by age 6. By the time American Pie hit VHS I had seen my first pair of movie boobs. I played Doom at age 7, Halo at age 11 and Grand Theft Auto III and Vice city by their respective release dates. Point being, I watched a lot of stuff that would be considered inappropriate at the time, and frankly even more inappropriate now with what feels to be the general parenting climate.

 I will concede, that I understand that these are anecdotes. However I don't think there is sufficient information to disprove my point given the ethical concerns raised by studying a child watching this type of media in early childhood. Still I'm fairly confident that consuming just about anything besides sesame street and other colorful educational television is going to provide a superior educational experience than anything on PBS or channels of its ilk.

This view is mostly inspired by my friends. One has a teen and he has been pretty straight laced about the media he is allowed to consume. (I.E. PG-13 at age 13) Recently on her podcast, his mother was talking about how she had to find age appropriate content to watch with him that she didn't have to suffer through on the Disney channel so that they had some bonding time. In this instance the content was Big Bang Theory. I rolled my eyes, because she's extremely progressive and still has these attitudes about the media her kid consumes. It almost feels like doing this to her kid is insincere and that she's just trying to show off her good parenting skills, and I kind of think that's true of a lot of parents. This is opposed to of course an actual concern for the media itself.

The second friend is a middle school teacher and toddler mom, and her student brought some Five-nights at freddies apparel to class. We had a discussion about it where she described the game to me (I was well aware of it years before this incident.) It all came off as fairly ignorant to me. Then I see the stuff her 18 month old is watching and its repetitive garbage. I get that toddlers really enjoy that kind of stuff, but I believe that this trend will continue to the detriment of the kid. 

I'm not here to be judgmental of my friends or other parents.

I apologise for this post being rather terse. A computer problem made me lose this entire post and I hastily rewrote it. I have two sections of my view: historical and modern. If you only want to discuss the modern part you can skip the historical part but you may lose context for my later views. 


Historical Islam


The election system in the Rashidun caliphate could have developed into democracy. There is a good chance the Arab conquests would have still happened without Islam but they role have been more brutal. The first fitna made Islam take an autocratic turn.


The hydraulic empire theory may explain why Islam started to move in an autocratic direction especially in MENA. In the same way that the Rashidun caliphate could conquer the area so easily other states could also do so by taking control of water sources. This made it so that over time as the fervor of the Sahaba for egalitarianism was lost the Islamic world transitioned into Autocratic governments which only rarely fell and when they did almost always just took the form of another person completely taking over the state. I think this occurred in ancient times too with the medean empire being succeeded by the Achamenid Empire being succeeded by the Seleucid empire, all having very similar sprawling borders. I think this created a more autocratic and violent culture in the region that will go away from globalization but still causes problems. I think this also limited the amount of states in the Islamic world causing a lack of competition in innovating new styles of government. This is most obvious in the case of the gunpowder empires: the Ottoman Safavid and Mughal empires which were geographically huge in contrast to European States at the time, although the Mughal empire might not qualify as a hydraulic empire, I believe it's success came from being able to get a larger per capita fighting force than Indian States due to not having a caste system at first. I think this explains the comparative success of Malaysia relative to the rest of the Islamic world as they have a completely different


Modern Islam


I think there are many problems with the state of modern Islam. Nonetheless I think that it can help people in their spirituality perhaps better than Christianity can now. Although it is dependent on a knowledge of the Arabic language that many people even in the Islamic world lack.


I think that countries in the MENA region have difficulty developing democracy because they still have the relic of a culture that used to be hydraulic empires. With a globalized economy that isn't really present though because people can just buy food on the international market. The exception would be oil rich economies like Saudi Arabia where oil has replaced water. I think this will go away over time as people are exposed to more foreign media, including American media and Indian media and even Chinese media. But I also think this means that imams from gulf Arab countries will be unintentionally spreading these attitudes when they preach in other countries. 


The most controversial idea I have in this is what I think is going on in Europe. I think that there is a legitimate problem of racism in Europe and unwillingness for governments to appear Islamophobic that causes massive problems for everyone and may result in massive societal problems later on. I think that european Muslims especially of refugee origin are self segregating and often unable to access social services and it's causing substantial problems in their communities. Refugees who often will have PTSD are not given treatment and instead often end up in closed off communities dominated by ad hoc Sharia courts and imams. This system is somewhere between religion and organized crime and usually has extremists take over and try to keep the communities segregated and speaking Arabic over local languages and get the birth rates as high as possible. The extremists want to demographically destroy Europe but almost nobody in the communities aside from these extremists wants to do that, it's not a threat at all but there is a threat of these subcultures existing long term that I will address at the end of this section. The solution to this problem is very simple: disperse housing for refugees among the native population enough that no segregation can occur, perhaps do a Singapore style enforced residential desegregation if things continue to be bad, and create specific phone lines for refugees to easily talk to someone who speaks their language about how to access social services and make it callable without a Sim card like emergency lines are. I also think that child services should be armed and willing to go to any length to find a possibly abused child. And I think anyone who destroys their passport and says they forget what country they are from should be jailed. I also think we need extremely strict hate speech laws well beyond current ones to prevent violence and make European Muslims more comfortable integrating with mainstream society. I think if we take these steps the immigrants and refugees from the middle East will completely integrate with European cultures but if they don't do this then there is a good chance people of middle Eastern descent will end up having a role similar to medieval Jews in Europe and have extreme difficulty in getting back to the middle East if they want to go back.


I support eliminating Visa restrictions worldwide, perhaps with the one restriction that countries without proper infrastructure will need to build it before becoming part of this Union, with refugees being allowed into anywhere regardless and am a strong globalist. I think Trump's Muslim ban is idiotic and the wall makes no sense, although I supported Democrats giving money for the wall to stop the shutdown since I think the shutdown did more damage than the wall would have done","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently got in a massive but of interpersonal trouble for allegedly having Islamophobic views. One of the people said that I was a normal person who got subliminally brainwashed by the alt right into believing these things without actually being a racist but I still got kicked out of a community for it despite my openness to hear what that person was saying, they later refused to talk to me because I was shunned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologise for this post being rather terse. A computer problem made me lose this entire post and I hastily rewrote it. I have two sections of my view: historical and modern. If you only want to discuss the modern part you can skip the historical part but you may lose context for my later views. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historical Islam&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The election system in the Rashidun caliphate could have developed into democracy. There is a good chance the Arab conquests would have still happened without Islam but they role have been more brutal. The first fitna made Islam take an autocratic turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hydraulic empire theory may explain why Islam started to move in an autocratic direction especially in MENA. In the same way that the Rashidun caliphate could conquer the area so easily other states could also do so by taking control of water sources. This made it so that over time as the fervor of the Sahaba for egalitarianism was lost the Islamic world transitioned into Autocratic governments which only rarely fell and when they did almost always just took the form of another person completely taking over the state. I think this occurred in ancient times too with the medean empire being succeeded by the Achamenid Empire being succeeded by the Seleucid empire, all having very similar sprawling borders. I think this created a more autocratic and violent culture in the region that will go away from globalization but still causes problems. I think this also limited the amount of states in the Islamic world causing a lack of competition in innovating new styles of government. This is most obvious in the case of the gunpowder empires: the Ottoman Safavid and Mughal empires which were geographically huge in contrast to European States at the time, although the Mughal empire might not qualify as a hydraulic empire, I believe it&amp;#39;s success came from being able to get a larger per capita fighting force than Indian States due to not having a caste system at first. I think this explains the comparative success of Malaysia relative to the rest of the Islamic world as they have a completely different&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern Islam&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there are many problems with the state of modern Islam. Nonetheless I think that it can help people in their spirituality perhaps better than Christianity can now. Although it is dependent on a knowledge of the Arabic language that many people even in the Islamic world lack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that countries in the MENA region have difficulty developing democracy because they still have the relic of a culture that used to be hydraulic empires. With a globalized economy that isn&amp;#39;t really present though because people can just buy food on the international market. The exception would be oil rich economies like Saudi Arabia where oil has replaced water. I think this will go away over time as people are exposed to more foreign media, including American media and Indian media and even Chinese media. But I also think this means that imams from gulf Arab countries will be unintentionally spreading these attitudes when they preach in other countries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most controversial idea I have in this is what I think is going on in Europe. I think that there is a legitimate problem of racism in Europe and unwillingness for governments to appear Islamophobic that causes massive problems for everyone and may result in massive societal problems later on. I think that european Muslims especially of refugee origin are self segregating and often unable to access social services and it&amp;#39;s causing substantial problems in their communities. Refugees who often will have PTSD are not given treatment and instead often end up in closed off communities dominated by ad hoc Sharia courts and imams. This system is somewhere between religion and organized crime and usually has extremists take over and try to keep the communities segregated and speaking Arabic over local languages and get the birth rates as high as possible. The extremists want to demographically destroy Europe but almost nobody in the communities aside from these extremists wants to do that, it&amp;#39;s not a threat at all but there is a threat of these subcultures existing long term that I will address at the end of this section. The solution to this problem is very simple: disperse housing for refugees among the native population enough that no segregation can occur, perhaps do a Singapore style enforced residential desegregation if things continue to be bad, and create specific phone lines for refugees to easily talk to someone who speaks their language about how to access social services and make it callable without a Sim card like emergency lines are. I also think that child services should be armed and willing to go to any length to find a possibly abused child. And I think anyone who destroys their passport and says they forget what country they are from should be jailed. I also think we need extremely strict hate speech laws well beyond current ones to prevent violence and make European Muslims more comfortable integrating with mainstream society. I think if we take these steps the immigrants and refugees from the middle East will completely integrate with European cultures but if they don&amp;#39;t do this then there is a good chance people of middle Eastern descent will end up having a role similar to medieval Jews in Europe and have extreme difficulty in getting back to the middle East if they want to go back.&lt;/p&gt;

Theory One: The ""Mirror"" theory. The Media is a reflection of society. The Media shows the people what's popular, what they want to see, because this is how profit is maximized. At least 2/3rds of America is dumb as rocks, so ridiculous shows shows like the Kardashians and ridiculous political views that appeal to life's losers (more free stuff, hate on the ""1%"") are what makes the media money. The media reflects society.

Now, for a while, I believed this theory to be largely correct. And if it were so, at least we should have some hope of fixing the problem by investing heavily in education. But I now believe the second theory is correct...
_____________

Theory Two: The ""Subversion"" theory. Media collectives actively attempt to sway public opinion for globalist, anti-American causes, even at the expense of their bottom line. Money does not matter to them as much as winning the ideological struggle for America's soul, and they will stop at nothing until our nation's neck is in the firm grasp of the globalists.

I had been leaning this way, but I witnessed something staggering at a bar the other day. I was amongst coworkers, for happy hour. Around 5pm. No sports on, but all the TVs were set to ESPN, as is customary for a bar. Daytime sports talks shows. Boring.

Within half an hour, merely glancing up at the TV every couple minutes, I was subjected to the following:

-NBA plans to stop using the term ""owner"" for its owners because of racial insensitivity. (This is disgusting. Every company has an owner. They own the company...they don't own you as a person. My company has an owner. I don't think a single person at my company, even blacks, are under the impression that they are slaves to this ""owner"" or that his title is a reference to slavery. But these privileged multimillionaire athletes are? Absolutely sickening.) Of course, ESPN doesn't blast them, you can guess what side they took.

-Some white runner doesn't like the nickname ""white lightning"" because it's raycist.

-Some stupid show where they talk about nothing of value and hold up signs in Spanish. I don't know why. That show certainly didn't exist back when I was a kid watching ESPN. Anything to pander to non-Americans I guess.

-A news story about how the NFL loves unbridled diversity and is giving away billions of dollars to help diversity causes

-Some ""Pride Month"" nonsense.

________________________

Now, let's back up a second, and understand why this doesn't make any sense. The type of people who are into sports hardcore enough to be tuning into sports talk shows at 5pm with no sports on are not generally Marxists. I know so many people, even centrist coworkers and such, who say they used to watch ESPN talk shows but they don't like it anymore and it's not about sports anymore. Why is ESPN targeting this demographic with culture-subverting messages? It seems like it would hurt their bottom line and is idiotic to do. I have no doubt it HAS hurt their viewership, unless they're getting some sweet special interest sponsor money to push views on us.

And it's like this everywhere. New York Times articles about why blacks have it tough, why immigrants are awesome, why saying ""Melting pot"" means you're basically Hitler, why the government should do more to censor wrong opinions of people who don't love unbridled diversity....

I think that media companies aren't just reflecting society's changing views when they push these stories, and that the likelier case is that there is a coordinate effort to subvert our societies. They push feminism and homosexuality to destroy our families and lower our birthrates, appeal to our sense of virtues and decency to guilt us into accepting refugees and foreigners and tolerating illegal immigrants (many of whom believe in socialism), until our nation is changed forever. Crippling white families and birthrates and getting us to tolerate migration so they can shove enough foreigners into Texas to make it a blue state seems to be the name of the game, and we're all here talking about tolerance and diversity as America's about to be destroyed forever.

So, CMV. Doesn't it seem like media companies are even willing to act against their own interests to push the globalist-marxist agenda on us, or is there a more benign explanation?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who&amp;#39;s been paying attention for the past few years knows that there&amp;#39;s a lot of horrible stuff being forced upon us by the media, pitting everyone against each other and drumming up Socialist-Marxist causes, praising everything foreign and hating on everything national and identity-maintaining.&lt;/p&gt;

-Transgender Issues-

-Things such as hormone therapy are not to be taken lightly. Those who identify as transgender should go through tests and have a fairly long time period, say about 6-12 months in between diagnosis and treatment just to make sure it isn’t just a phase or something they’ll regret. The transgender movement should be accepted, but not largely encouraged as young people are easily swayed and they may believe something about themselves that they will change their mind about later, leading to potentially regrettable life choices.

-Children should be taught about trans people and learn to accept them as anyone else would be, but it should not be pushed upon them by crazy parents and they should wait to come of age (maybe eighteen) before they make the choice for themselves.


Those are pretty much my only issues with the transgender movement, and these criticisms I believe are perfectly normal and fine to have. Now onto my issues for those who criticise the movement.

-Refusal to use pronouns: Okay, I’ll admit the whole xhe/xhem/xher pronouns and stuff like that are daft, but should it be too much of an issue to address someone how they ask to be addressed? If you were speaking to some guy called John Smith and he asked you to call him “John” instead of “Mr Smith” you’d call him by his first name, right? So why should it be any different for transgender people? If someone was called Harry and now they want to be called Lucy why don’t you just call them it? It would be the kind thing to do, instead of just being contrarian and disrespectful. It really makes no difference to your life, it barely affects you in the slightest except for having a bit of awkwardness when you first start using the pronouns.

-Labelling transgenders as “mentally ill”: I’ll be honest, I haven’t done much research into this area, and that’s one of the main reasons why I made this post, however I’ll state my current point on this matter. Calling transgenders mentally ill is just a rude thing to do. It’s got pretty negative connotations, and I’d imagine there would be a better word to describe body dysmorphia with. People who make this statement tend to do so very smugly and matter-of-factly and it’s really obvious from the way they say it that they don’t really care about transgender people at all, they just like having a group they’re allowed to insult and demean. It’s mostly a superiority thing, people label others as mentally ill (transgenders are traditionally left) and they validate their own opinions and feel better about themselves. Instead of doing this why don’t the people who say these things look at it from an understanding angle and try and help transgenders to be able to achieve happiness without drastically changing their lives? I know the answer, it’s because they just don’t care about them and they enjoy mocking them and offending them for no reason other than cheap laughs and a moment of moral superiority.

That’s my opinion on the matter, and I realise it’s probably pretty skewed and biased in favour of transgender people, so I’d like to hear some proper arguments against the movement instead of just the usual vitriol you see in YouTube and Facebook.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will list my issues with the transgender movement first, and then those who criticise it second.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the big problems comes from the fact that even when pretty much every sane person is sick of the government and its policies we cant really change them because they:

1. Straight up buy votes from the poor, uneducated minorities (Romas and Turkish minorities)

2. Their campaigns are full of lies but people somehow still fall for them. Another typical eastern Europe thing they do is organize little concerts and give out free food.

3. Educated people leave the country as soon as they can because they know their vote will be thrown into the void while the 3 main political powers get their votes no matter how much they steal and lie.

It seems to me that pure democracy never works when there is a big part of the countries population that is uneducated even to a basic level. For me it's reasonable to get the right to vote after you get your free education, learn about basic law, politics, ethics and morals.

Right now you only need to be 18 years old to vote and in perspective this is really strange. You could have zero idea how to read or even write your own name and you are part of the electing of the government. (Trust me it happen)

Edit 1: I think I need to clarify what kind of education I am talking about. Here in Bulgaria we have few levels of free education they are not bound to a specific school so no matter how elit your school is you get the same level as everyone else.

1. Begginer level of education (4th grade)

2. Medium education (8th grade/~14 years old)

3. Fundamental education (12th grade)

When I talk about the education requirement I reffer to the second level (I call it basic education in the comments since its easier to understand) I feel like such a low barrier will actually encourage people to stay in school and won't create a elitist society.

For other folks that identify as white that aren't bigots, I think they just accept the colloquially used term because while white is a group they can identify with, it's not a true ethnicity in the sense that there is not a homogenous culture, language, set of values, foods, or region associated with individuals who can pass as white. People such as [Carol Channing](https://www.beaconbroadside.com/broadside/2019/01/before-passing-away-carol-channing-passed-for-white.html) stand out in stark contrast to Barrack Obama or Tiger Woods. The only explanation is that culturally, the only thing that matters is skin color, and so white is conflated with ethnicity, but is actually a term of exclusion that reinforces bigoted notions of white supremacy. The confusion around the difference between white and [Black (which is an ethnicity as I explain here)](https://taooftomo.com/the-problem-with-the-white-race-47721e86e26c) results in the misunderstanding that ""white"" people are being marginalized or attacked, when the truth is that their ethnicities are simply being ""white-washed"" in favor of the less nuanced term that is being promoted by ignorant bigots. What's scary is that this seems to be INTENTIONAL on the part of white nationalists, and the fact that its working means that as a society we need to do something to demonstrate how dumb this idea actually is.

And an important place to start, in my view, is by addressing how one of the main standards for ""whiteness"" that is tacitly used is the [""one drop rule""](https://www.baystatebanner.com/2017/12/27/u-s-still-clings-to-one-drop-rule/). A rule that is only selectively applied to the label ""white"". A label that, if it DID refer to an ethnicity, would naturally include both Barrack Obama and Carol Channing, amongst many, many others. So...

Rather than pushing against the term, which some people identify with simply because they haven't really thought about it...

Why not go in the opposite direction? We have genetic testing. If a word is going to mean anything, it should be held to the same standard as other words in that category. If ""white"" is an ethnicity, then even ""1 drop"" of European ancestry should qualify anyone to mark that off on the census, on your DL, on job applications, etc. Why shouldn't those of us who have been excluded by racists and bigots appropriate this term by virtue of the integrity of how these terms are intended to be used by the professionals in the field that use them?

If this is done, there will by necessity come an inflection point where we have to ask if this term is useful at all, because if everyone is ""white"" regardless of skin color... what the hell is the point in the term?

The US gives ""benefits"" to people who are poor.  This can be anything from health care to rent assistance to even a free phone. There is no denying with a home and health insurance people are bound to lead more productive lives.  This helps everyone. I am not arguing that.  I am arguing that basing those ""benefits"" on your income level is unfair and it makes people who earn more money pay a penalty based on their success. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would argue our society should be set up like public school; that everyone is entitled to the same thing regardless of income and if you want something above and beyond you can pay for it.  I don't think the government should say ""public school is only for poor kids and wealthy parents need to pay for it"".  I doubt most people would agree with that.  yet that's exactly what we do in health care, rent assistance, food stamps, etc. We give a benefit to people who less money while ignoring those benefits for people with higher income. Half of my wife's income goes to those two items I mentioned, which doesn't even address housing or other necessities. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's use my family as an example.  Our two kids cost $1,500 per month for daycare = $18,000 per year.  Subtract a $5,000 childcare tax benefit, and we are still paying taxes on $13,000 of cost which is, in our case, about $17,500 pretax income. Our family health care is $750/month. This is untaxed, but still $9,000 per year. So, with childcare and insurance we have to earn $31,500 per year before taxes just to pay for those items.  People who may have dropped out of high school, or work a bad job, or whatever, get money from the state and federal government to help with these expenses. They are basically getting money from the government for not being successful.  \*Please note I am not making a judgement on WHY they are in that position, simply that they are in that positions\*.

&lt;p&gt;Edit: ok, I get it now. Most illegal immigrants are paid standard wages, not sub-minimum wage, and won’t be affected with a strict enforcement of minimum wage. If the Democratic Party centres the conversation around minimum wage, they might receive reinforced support from their base but will probably not persuade voters actually looking for constructive solutions to the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

I like the premise, the true feeling of hopelessnes you get for humanity in the first few episodes and the overall concept but the rest...

The pace at which the story progresses is jarring! Characters spend episode after episode reciting the same tired narrative of the tragedy of their situation, talking while rarely doing anything proactive. If I get one more monologue of Eren spending 2 minutes of screentime pittying himself/reminiscing over what people just said I'll smash my TV... Every second long action scene (or progress in general) is preceeded by at least 2 episodes full of recaps, inner monologue and here and there a bit of character development.
Compare AoT to, let's say Code Geass or Death Note and try to compare how much story- and character progression each one packs into 25 episodes... It's not even close. 

Concerning the characters I really wished there was more development. Everyone seems to be defined by a single quirk which might be fine for less relevant characters but even more important cast members like Mikasa and Armin get pretty much no progress at all. The later at least realizes he is not a complete waste of space but apart from that?

Another thing that really annoys me is the animation. To make that clear: I like the style, it captures the style of the manga quite well. But the actual movement screams ""budget conservation"" at nearly all times. So many shots are just reused over and over throughout an episode (the forest-chase in ep.19/20 being probably the worst case) and on the rare occasions where you could put in some really sweet Sakuga-moments they just do the opposite and give us 5 unmoving, sepia-pictures which look fine the first time but get old fast. 

P.S.: A few general things for the discussion. Firstly I don't mind in the slightest if you love this anime. I know the fan base is gigantic and people have different reasons for liking/disliking something. I tried to apply some ""objective"" standards here in the hope of making my point a bit more comprehensive but of course I'm not free from bias. Secondly, the manga DOESNT count.

I'm 26, for what it's worth.*

My building had a call box out front. It had a button for each unit. When you pressed my button, there was instantaneous buzz inside my unit. There was a phone on my wall with one button. With one press, the gate instantaneously unlocked for as long as I held it. 

We just got a new system. Very fancy. It's got video chat, electronic keys that you can place restrictions on, the works. (It's called butterfly MX.) The outside panel is now touchscreen. To buzz my unit, people need to scroll through to find my name. The *only* access I have to let them in is through an app on my phone. It takes like 5-10 seconds for their call to go through, at which point, it's only a few seconds away from automatically hanging up. So I have to kind of panic when the call arrives. One time I didn't answer in time so I had to go into the app and manually fumble to open the door. I could have just walked over to the button and been done with it by now. God forbid my phone dies. There's no analog backup. If I don't answer the app, the backup is that it gives me a phone call. 

It's really nice that I can see the person outside my unit, but I don't need that. The big pro I guess is you can let people in while you're not home. But IMO that's what a lockbox is for. By untethering this practical need from a tactile object, it's made everything more inconvenient *on average.*

Another example: iPhone's new facial recognition. I'm not so purist that I advocate for non-touchscreen phones (or landlines), but up until now the iPhone has had a button I could press when all else failed. A button to just take me home. It struck a nice balance. 

Fingerprint recognition removed a barrier to access. It's quicker than a passcode. Facial recognition **adds** a barrier. It has a higher failure rate and requires more specific actions. You *must* hold the phone up to your face. What if I want to check it under the table?

Moreover, there's something I just can't quantify, but I feel very strongly about it. Elevator close buttons haven't worked since the 90's, but when they took them away it was distressing to the public, so they added back ones that don't work. Most people know they don't work, but we like having them there. It's entirely irrational, but what matters is that it's a comfort. Sometimes that's an end unto itself. 

An actual single purpose button that does reliably does an actual thing when you need it is a comfort, but incidentally, it's also practical, and for some reason, modern businesses seem obsessed with getting rid of them. 

To CMV, you first need to acknowledge that this sometimes goes too far. I'm not gonna believe you if you're like ""well you're just against change and progress."" Yeah I may be resistant to change a normal human amount, but I also know a good improvement when I see it.

Second, there's no convincing me that these systems are good now, they're just not. They frustrate me, and that's that. So the question is whether we're in an awkward transition period and they will eventually become so seamless that I lose the desire for analog. I don't currently see that, but maybe you can find examples of that. Also understand that my argument is not to replace email with traditional mail or something like that, I'm arguing for balance.

Maybe I should start off by defining, what does psychopath or sociopath mean? Surprisingly, it isn't the criminal serial killer sadist that you probably are thinking of. Psychopaths, or sociopaths, are people who have a non-functional part of the brain, which takes away their ability to feel *empathy*. It also inhibits the rest of their emotions, or dampens them; specifically, negative emotions such as shame, fear, stress, etc.

Now that we know that they're not the villains that we thought they were, what makes them so bad? Well... Nothing. It's just a media-influenced topic. In fact, most serial killers and criminals are like us, normal people - or in scientific terms, Neurotypical.

Now, we hate them because they lack empathy and fear, and constantly demean them as monsters while we have empathy, so we must be nice people. However, this  comment, and many others I've seen not localized to this post, seem to be empathy devoid. In fact, many are vindicative and demand that the people they're talking about suffer more, which a psychopath or sociopath would not do; they would simply look on indifferently. This shows an example of how empathy can make us more cruel and sadistic than our emotionally impaired counterparts. 

In fact, most actions that cause harm to others are driven by empathy and emotions. Murdering a cheating spouse? Hurt by infidelity. Bad abusive childhood? Violent tendencies. Sadism requires the mental component of enjoyment, which psychopaths lack. The question I see most commonly is that, if psychopaths and sociopaths lack empathy, then what is stopping them from committing crime? I see this question as completely stupid, because there are so many reasons to not commit crime - if the only reason you wouldn't commit crime is because you would feel guilty afterwards, then that's pretty alarming. 

Furthermore, when people ask psychopaths or sociopaths this question, the answer is surprisingly obvious - ""Why should I?"" There's no motive, and they don't like wasting their time and effort. Breaking the law comes with consequences they don't like, so they especially avoid it. Asking them why they don't murder is like asking a weak high school nerd why they don't play sports - ""I don't want to."" 

So why do we constantly see ourselves as better than them? Why do we regard empathy as the reason how we're better people than them?

""What is coercive control?

Coercive control is when a person with whom you are personally connected, repeatedly behaves in a way which makes you feel controlled, dependent, isolated or scared.

The following types of behaviour are common examples of coercive control:

isolating you from your friends and family

controlling how much money you have and how you spend it

monitoring your activities and your movements

repeatedly putting you down, calling you names or telling you that you are worthless""

...... 


""Your abuser will be guilty of the offence of coercive control if

he is personally connected to you, and

his behaviour has had a serious effect on you, and

your abuser knew or ought to have known that his behaviour would have a serious effect on you.

 

What does serious effect mean?

Your abuser’s behaviour is considered to have a serious effect on you if:

on at least two occasions you have feared that violence will be used against you, or

you have felt serious alarm or distress and it has had a substantial effect on your usual day to day activities. The behaviour has had a substantial effect on you if it has caused you to change the way you live. For example, you may have changed the way you socialise, your physical or mental health may have deteriorated, you may have changed the way you do household chores or how you care for your children. If you have changed the way you live in order to keep you or your children safe from harm, it is possible that the behaviour you are experiencing is coercive control.""

I’ve heard many arguments saying that “maybe they don’t have anything else to wear”. Maybe if your whole bag was lost at sea or blown up or your friends had pranked you and hidden it. But even for those coming off of a long deployment not having any civilian clothes at all is next to unheard of. On top of that (can’t speak for the other branches, as I don’t know their rules and regulations) for the navy coming home videos you always see the blue camp uniform. It is literally written in black and white, this uniform shall only be used for work and to commute to and from work, stops along the commute to work are permitted. There is absolutely no reason to wear it except to draw attention to yourself and be able to post a video for all of your friends to thank you for your service. But maybe I’m just angry not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

That's dumb. I think the government's economic role is absolutely to enforce externalities the market ignores, to ensure transparent trade, and to cover markets where fair trade can't really exist (defense, science, end-user medicine). I also think it's a good idea to strongly discourage corporate/wealthy hoarding of some things with extremely limited potential for growth, like housing.

But THAT SAID the underlying principles that that movement was originally based on seem to make far more sense than the demand side alternative. I think that's because, at the core, we don't live in a post scarcity society and the economy is always supply limited and never demand limited. My points here are primarily going to be related to redistribution of wealth.

In practice, I fail to see how putting more money in the hands of the general populace will actually make them more prosperous if it's not matched *at least* by an identical increase in production efficiency. Similarly, I fail to see how an increase in production efficiency *wouldn't* make people better off even if they don't have any extra currency in their pockets.

To expand on the first point: inflation. If no new supply is created, then it will always be the same number of people bidding against each other for the same number of resources. The price will just go up. That's because currency doesn't actually have a concrete value, it's just a token weighing system we use to balance desire in society. That desire will be the same no matter how many tokens are used to measure it.

The second point expands from the first. While quantity of money is fuzzy in value, supply and demand isn't. More efficient production means more supply which means an alleviation of the desire. That greater efficiency means fewer hours and scarce resources go into it's production, which means it takes up a smaller effective slice of a human being's life to create it and trade it for something else. Ultimately time is one of the only assets with a fixed value, so things requiring less time to create means others have to spend less time to acquire them.

To make an oversimplified analogy: If ten people make nine widgets, someone has to go without no matter how much money they all have. If ten people make eleven widgets, everyone gets one no matter how poor they are.

In real life, this means that while I'm all for progressively taxing the income gap I don't actually see much of a point in addressing the wealth disparity itself. The rich aren't using up all the hospitals, the colleges, or the food. Their wealth exists in the form of continually reinvested fractions of factories and intellectual property and it's value exists purely in it's perception OF value. It could all evaporate overnight on a market whim, which can't happen with food, medicine, housing, or labor. If you force them to sell it to pay taxes, nothing is ACTUALLY contributed to society. That factory and IP had to be purchased by someone else, either a different rich person already being taxed or a foreign power we probably don't want to cede ownership to at reduced prices. Functionally, anything taken in tax is immediately lost to deflation or is ceded to a foreign oligarch not beholden to local laws.

I constantly see the claim that putting more money on people's hands will encourage businesses to compete to produce to obtain that money while a poor consumer population has no money to spend and leads to stagnation. That sounds right only when money has an inflexible value. No matter how many individual dollars are in the consumers' pockets, they will always have the same time and expertise to trade for goods and services. I've seen foretellings of a dystopian future where the ultrawealthy own the capacity to effortlessly end all of humanity's ills but they choose not to because people are too poor to afford it and I just cannot imagine that being remotely possible, even if that precise disparity came to exist in the first place. The ability to produce is meaningless if you aren't using it and there is no reason not to trade something free for something that isn't.

I think if you want to improve quality of life for the masses, you literally can't do it by attacking the wealth gap because that is an intangible symptom rather than a cause. You have to make things better by improving supply, because that will necessarily result in a lowering of prices and a greater material wealth to the consumer. That means preventing price gouging but it also means letting corporations and the wealthy run wild as long as they're not leveraging power to abuse. 

Most importantly, though, I think it means providing the consumers' with the ability to generate high value for their time and expertise. One of the best ways to increase supply is to educate consumers. If we flood the market with doctors, engineers, and software developers, the individual salaries in those professions will tank but the net benefit to society in the form of cheaper medicine, cheaper goods, and greater automation will far outweigh the losses.

I'd like my view changed because *I am all for reducing the wealth gap* if it will *actually* help people and won't just *immediately* go up in smoke as those people sell off the redistributed wealth just to try and maintain an identical standard of living in the newly inflated market. I think people should be rewarded for effort, investment, and risk but that it's silly to let that reward extend all the way to the creation of a modern feudal system. I don't want to rail against a solution I'm morally in favor of over a macroeconomic misconception.

1) I’m not arguing that no LGBT people fall into these stereotypical categories. I know that there are gay men who happen to be more effeminate than other men, and I know that there are gay women who happen to be more ‘butch’ than other women.

2) I’m not arguing that TV and movies should never include characters that fit these stereotypes. To the extent that people in real life fit these stereotypical categories, it is certainly fine to occasionally include these types of characters. 

3) I’m not arguing that TV and movies never include characters that don’t fit these stereotypes. You can occasionally find exceptions to this type of one-dimensional stereotypical character writing, but those are exceptions that prove the rule; the vast majority of LGBT portrayals outnumber these exceptions.

Here’s what I’m arguing:

There’s been a trend lately to include blatantly stereotyped LGBT characters in shows and movies. If a character is gay, you can be 75%-85% sure that if male, he’ll be artsy, over-dramatic, exceptionally fashion-conscious, and effeminate. If female, she’ll be tomboyish, more masculine than the average woman and overly assertive; basically the opposite of the gay male category.

(EDIT: the 75%-85% figure above is just a personal guess based on my experience of TV and movies—I do not claim any scientific accuracy in those numbers, it’s just based on my experience, not research.)

Since these stereotypes are heavily associated with the LGBT community, our society pats itself on the back and counts this increase in gay characters as a fabulous display of cultural acceptance—how far have we come from the days of homophobic intolerance to have such an accepting and open media environment!

Does the outsized presence of stereotypical gay characters really indicate progress and acceptance, though? In what other aspect of society, either currently or historically, would we look upon the perpetuation of stereotypes about an entire group of people as a positive indicator of progress? Can we find any other example? 

The problem with media stereotypes is that they disseminate a false sense of understanding about an (invariably) variegated group of people. They render as basic that which is complex. It’s almost like trying to explain in a few words emotions like love or hate; it’s impossible, since they take so many forms of expression depending on context, individual personality, mood, etc. Would we ever seriously argue that the entire stratum of love as experienced by people emotionally is captured in one romantic film? Of course not. But if enough movies and shows were to put forth some basic stereotypes about love, I’m certain that people would come to feel that they *know* what love is, even though that’s entirely false.

The same goes for the present discussion about LGBT stereotypes: if stereotyped characters are included with enough frequency and at the overall expense of other more complex gay characters, people will come to view the gay community as wholly encompassing those attributes. If people accept these stereotypes as representative of the average gay person, and accept “gay people” based on this flawed understanding, are they really accepting LGBT people as a whole, or are they simply accepting the fun, hot, trendy character they’re taking to be “gay guys”? I’d argue it’s the latter.

Acceptance of stereotypes about LGBT people is not a measure of progress. Acceptance of LGBT people because they are people is the only real and lasting measure of progress. 

I’m afraid that as long as these stereotypes remain acceptable as the common portrayal of gay people in media, and as long as they continue to be pointed at as a sign of positive progress for our culture, genuine acceptance will not be achieved.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, here’s what I’m NOT arguing:&lt;/p&gt;

MC Lyte, Lauryn Hill, Salt N Pepa, Missy Elliot all showed they could compete with any male when expressing there musical talent but its not like that now.

If you say Nicki Minaj can't compare to Eminem, the excuse you'll usually hear is you can't compare the two especially since Nicki's a female rapper but the implications of this defense are incredibly harmful, what your basically saying is you can't compare female rappers to male rappers because they're not naturally as good.

But can you blame them, my female hip hop playlist consists of MC Lyte, Queen Latifah, Salt N Pepa, Lauryn Hill, Dessa, K Flay, Angel Haze, Snow Tha Product, Rapsody, Lady Sovereign, Envy, Kellee Maize, Nova Rockafeller, Jean Grae, Ms.Krayzie, Karmin

But if you mentioned any of these names to any young girl, they'd be lucky to know who even one of them is, so whos getting all the promotion then.

If you asked who's your favorite female rapper, you'll be told Nicki Minaj, Cardi B or to a lesser extent Iggy Azalea and there's two reasons for that.

There gimmicks sold to horny teenage boys and a perpetuated vision of what young girls hope they can be when they grow up which is attractive.

You don't believe me, click on any explicit Nicki Minaj, Cardi B and Iggy Azalea video and it will look almost identical to a pornhub comment system.

Nicki Minaj and Iggy Azalea aren't lyrical, they don't rap about anything interesting but at least to some extent they can rap and seem to express an interest in there music.

But then there's the odd one out, Cardi B who can't write her own music, come up with her own flows and has even stated she doesn't care about her music, as long as it sells well.

I first heard of Cardi B years ago, I think it was the time around her first mixtape was out, no one cared about it, it was a bland cliche ridden mess (same formula she's using now) but her music wasn't what made her stand out, it was her instagram page which I genuinely couldn't believe when I saw it.

Looking through her posts there was a video of her making fun of a Chinese woman by lifting her eyes and making racist oriental sounds.

A video of her talking about how she doesn't want to waste any time hanging around these dark skinned roaches.

A video where she openly laughed and said most of you faggots must have been raised with no daddies.

A video where she implicated she would get a man raped by a transgender woman.

And one where she boasted about drugging and robbing men as if it was something to be proud of.

Her most famous video at the time, was a fight she had on love and hip hop with some other contestant where she flung a shoe at her for sleeping with her man.

I thought she was a disgusting human piece of trash and quickly forgot about her until I heard this , horrific song called Bodak Yellow.

I recognized the name after hearing it enough, and was like, wait is this the same one but it was and checking her instagram page, all her previous videos had been completely deleted.

While she was dealing with this drama, people began to question did she rip off one of Kodaks blacks songs because it sounded eerily similar to Bodak yellow, to which she replied I was just inspired by it, which to me sounds like a joke.

She was also caught lying later saying the song had gained traction and blown up saying it was cause of her hard work when with a little bit of digging it was revealed that radio stations were paid ridiculous amounts and not only that she had a suspiciosly large budget for a new artist in fact one of the highest in the world.

The video of her implicating rape by a trans person popped up and was beginning to amass a controversy.

Her facebook page popped up a transphobic meme which she immediately denied when called out for claiming her facebook page had not been under her control for a year.

Which sounds like the most stupidest excuse I've ever heard, Atlantic, one of the biggest music labels in the world has left one of there biggest artists fan pages under someone they didn't knows control for a whole year, sounds likely.

Most people weren't buying it so she took to Instagram live stream to do what I thought would be an apology.

Smugly she sat there victimizing herself talking about how she didn't know tranny was a bad word repeating it again and again while completely ignoring any of the context that she was implying before branding anyone who disagreed with her as a hater.

But it was quickly forgotten about as she found herself dealing with a couple of tweets she had made earlier a couple with racist statements but there was one that stood out the most.

In an argument on twitter, she was arguing with a woman, to which she began to make fun of the woman's dead baby referring to him as a monkey

What got to me was when she claimed she was a feminist, because it was the most pandering lie to ever come out of her mouth

Not only was there videos of her attacking woman for sleeping with her man all over the internet but countless videos of her making fun of woman.

In fact she found herself in a brawl in a strip club at this time where she allegedly tried to pay two men to beat up two woman who had slept with offset, feminism ladies

She just came out of court for that a few days ago to screaming fans cause she's apparently an inspiration.

But that was replaced quickly by another controversy, where a video of someone rapping the first verse to bartier cardi a year before its release began to take front stage.

After a while she jumped onto instragram obviously annoyed and began ignoring the context of why people were annoyed in the first place by saying everyone else is doing it before saying she didn't care about hip hop or the music just the money it was getting her and she wasn't a rapper she was an entertainer

But not long after that she won a Grammy, winning over hardworking artiats for hip hop and she was swiftly attacked for winning it.

But she was quick to defend herself talking about how hard she worked on this album and deserved it despite the fact she was so quick to dissacociate herself from hip hop when it got tough, so she's a hip hop artist when it benefits her needs.

When the whole Nicki Minaj beef started and this began a while new era of manipulation, Cardi fans screamed at Nicki and her fans about Nickis choices such as going out with a registered sex offender completely ignoring even though she had some extremely valid points in her argument like why wouldn't Cardi admit to a lie detector test, how come even though she said Nicki went after her kid and she attacked her because that was too far when Nicki had interviews of her stating she'd go after anyone's kids cause it was fair game.

But then the most recent controversy arose the video of her admitting she drugged and robbed men popped up and she was forced to respond.

She used her normal defense calling everyone's haters complaining about how she needed to survive but then immediately saying she needed 50 grand at the time for studio time.

She never responded after that just said everyone was out to get her by using her past against her and released a song called press attacking the people that wrote about her.

But yet when these same blogs had nothing but nice things to say about her she was all over them

 And now shes coming out defending female rappers who have ghostwriters instead of actually promoting anyone who does, its degrading to actual woman who work hard to be seen as a legitimate rapper in hip hop and not just a sex object.

The only time i've seen Cardi apologize was when Martin Luther Kings wife called her out for a racist portrayal of her

Other than that, she never answers a question directly instead repeating how she's the victim of haters labelling anyone who's offended by what she's done a hater, a tactic artists have been using to avoid criticism for years.

Yeah there's terrible rappers these days especially male but for a lil Xan, you have an eminem, for a lil yachty, you have a Nas, for a Sixnine, you have a Rakim, there's somewhat a balance at least.

For a Cardi B you have a Nicki Minaj two rappers with no lyrical prescence in hip hop.

And with Cardi B being claimed as this feminist icon under the guise of woman should be able to express themselves sexually to make money is untrue.

Because that's all shes really bringing to the table and if you're all your selling is sexuality then how can you can't be selling yourself completely as a female because sexuality is only one part about being a woman.

watch the way shes the one who'll bring up shes a stripper majorly to coax people into thinking her being a stripper is the reason why people are so bothered with her as a elongated ploy to trick young girls into thinking she's only getting hate cause she's a successful woman and what she's done is exaggerated by haters to stop her getting money.

All these things I've mentioned as well, one of these things could have destroyed someone's careers but a lot of people don't even know some of these things and that's because I assume her label is always trying to cover for her

You might think i'm crazy but it literally took me over a week to find the instagram videos I was talking about to which I saved because it seemed someone went through a lot of trouble to delete there existence.

And test it for yourself, the next big Cardi B controversy that hits, wait a small bit and see how quickly an influx of what Cardi is wearing or where's she's performing begin popping up everywhere in an attempt to bury the controversy

I've seen her do nothing but manipulate, lie, steal, be homophobic, racist, transphobic, bullying, and treat her fans like idiots.

And whenever she's called out for it she points fingers in every direction accusing those who raised the question of being haters even if they're her own fans.

Telling them we need to support woman when she can't do it herself, one woman getting money is not feminism, especially if she's getting
It for working much less than the majority of female rappers.

I am an open person so try and give me a reason any at all why she deserves anything that she has because all I can see is a monster who will screw over anyone for money and only thinks about her own interests.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who&amp;#39;s been a fan of hip hop for as long as I can possibly recall, there was a few things that I always had a massive amount of appreciation for, people who write there own lyrics, try interesting instrumentals, having a unique flow and discussing topics that aren&amp;#39;t cliche topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an argument on twitter, she was arguing with a woman, to which she began to make fun of the woman&amp;#39;s dead baby referring to him as a monkey&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What got to me was when she claimed she was a feminist, because it was the most pandering lie to ever come out of her mouth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only was there videos of her attacking woman for sleeping with her man all over the internet but countless videos of her making fun of woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact she found herself in a brawl in a strip club at this time where she allegedly tried to pay two men to beat up two woman who had slept with offset, feminism ladies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She just came out of court for that a few days ago to screaming fans cause she&amp;#39;s apparently an inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that was replaced quickly by another controversy, where a video of someone rapping the first verse to bartier cardi a year before its release began to take front stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while she jumped onto instragram obviously annoyed and began ignoring the context of why people were annoyed in the first place by saying everyone else is doing it before saying she didn&amp;#39;t care about hip hop or the music just the money it was getting her and she wasn&amp;#39;t a rapper she was an entertainer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not long after that she won a Grammy, winning over hardworking artiats for hip hop and she was swiftly attacked for winning it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But she was quick to defend herself talking about how hard she worked on this album and deserved it despite the fact she was so quick to dissacociate herself from hip hop when it got tough, so she&amp;#39;s a hip hop artist when it benefits her needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the whole Nicki Minaj beef started and this began a while new era of manipulation, Cardi fans screamed at Nicki and her fans about Nickis choices such as going out with a registered sex offender completely ignoring even though she had some extremely valid points in her argument like why wouldn&amp;#39;t Cardi admit to a lie detector test, how come even though she said Nicki went after her kid and she attacked her because that was too far when Nicki had interviews of her stating she&amp;#39;d go after anyone&amp;#39;s kids cause it was fair game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then the most recent controversy arose the video of her admitting she drugged and robbed men popped up and she was forced to respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She used her normal defense calling everyone&amp;#39;s haters complaining about how she needed to survive but then immediately saying she needed 50 grand at the time for studio time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She never responded after that just said everyone was out to get her by using her past against her and released a song called press attacking the people that wrote about her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But yet when these same blogs had nothing but nice things to say about her she was all over them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now shes coming out defending female rappers who have ghostwriters instead of actually promoting anyone who does, its degrading to actual woman who work hard to be seen as a legitimate rapper in hip hop and not just a sex object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only time i&amp;#39;ve seen Cardi apologize was when Martin Luther Kings wife called her out for a racist portrayal of her&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, she never answers a question directly instead repeating how she&amp;#39;s the victim of haters labelling anyone who&amp;#39;s offended by what she&amp;#39;s done a hater, a tactic artists have been using to avoid criticism for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah there&amp;#39;s terrible rappers these days especially male but for a lil Xan, you have an eminem, for a lil yachty, you have a Nas, for a Sixnine, you have a Rakim, there&amp;#39;s somewhat a balance at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a Cardi B you have a Nicki Minaj two rappers with no lyrical prescence in hip hop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with Cardi B being claimed as this feminist icon under the guise of woman should be able to express themselves sexually to make money is untrue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because that&amp;#39;s all shes really bringing to the table and if you&amp;#39;re all your selling is sexuality then how can you can&amp;#39;t be selling yourself completely as a female because sexuality is only one part about being a woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;watch the way shes the one who&amp;#39;ll bring up shes a stripper majorly to coax people into thinking her being a stripper is the reason why people are so bothered with her as a elongated ploy to trick young girls into thinking she&amp;#39;s only getting hate cause she&amp;#39;s a successful woman and what she&amp;#39;s done is exaggerated by haters to stop her getting money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these things I&amp;#39;ve mentioned as well, one of these things could have destroyed someone&amp;#39;s careers but a lot of people don&amp;#39;t even know some of these things and that&amp;#39;s because I assume her label is always trying to cover for her&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might think i&amp;#39;m crazy but it literally took me over a week to find the instagram videos I was talking about to which I saved because it seemed someone went through a lot of trouble to delete there existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And test it for yourself, the next big Cardi B controversy that hits, wait a small bit and see how quickly an influx of what Cardi is wearing or where&amp;#39;s she&amp;#39;s performing begin popping up everywhere in an attempt to bury the controversy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen her do nothing but manipulate, lie, steal, be homophobic, racist, transphobic, bullying, and treat her fans like idiots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And whenever she&amp;#39;s called out for it she points fingers in every direction accusing those who raised the question of being haters even if they&amp;#39;re her own fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telling them we need to support woman when she can&amp;#39;t do it herself, one woman getting money is not feminism, especially if she&amp;#39;s getting
It for working much less than the majority of female rappers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am an open person so try and give me a reason any at all why she deserves anything that she has because all I can see is a monster who will screw over anyone for money and only thinks about her own interests.&lt;/p&gt;

Playing devil's advocate is arguing against a side you actually agree with for the purpose of argument, or even just to get the other sides views more representation. If you disagree that this is a good definition for devil's advocate, why? To be clear, this is probably the least likely way to C my V, because definitions are pretty fluid and at best, you'll convince me I phrased my view badly,  and I'll have to rephrase it as ""It is bad to bring up arguments for a side you disagree with for the purpose of argument if you don't explain why you still disagree.""

The reason specifically for my view is that playing devil's advocate seems nice,  since you are fairly representing the other side,  but if you are playing *devil's* advocate, you disagree with the side you are arguing for. Even if you want to fairly represent the side,  you can still go ahead and explain their views,  but also why you disagree with them. If you do the former,  but not the latter,  you are being intellectually dishonest, and moving further away from the goal of a debate.

The same cannot be said for sperm."" Yes this is true and it's good you were more fair,  but this is intellectually dishonest unless you also say, ""However I still am pro choice because of bodily autonomy.""

Fast forward hundreds of years and, we fought for Suffrage, we fought for freedom. and now we all have a voice.

But despite our advancements, democracy has not changed. While pebbles have been replaced with paper, the idea is the same.

But Democracy is not the height of our political systems. I propose a E-Democracy- or Digital Democracy.  

digital democracy leverages the internet and our digital networks to ensure complete transparency in government. Through the use of technologies like the block-chain and digital ledgers. We could track every single vote, transaction, decision - and respond in real-time to our government's actions.

we would no longer live in a world where our country has a constant watch on us, but a world where we have a constant watch on our government.

Government spending could be tracked and recorded, The pockets of corrupt politicians could not longers be filled with YOUR MONEY. as a result, the taxes needed to keep the current infrastructures open would drop dramatically.

The government could publically publish law reforms and citizens could respond in real time, their support or disdain. reducing the bureaucracy of the legal system.

Public Projects could be monitored. Does it really cost 10 million to construct a 1km of road? with a Digital Democracy, we would know for sure. 

The transparency of a digital democracy ensures that the wealth the government acquires is used the most effective way possible to benefits YOU. Slip-ups and corruption are all traceable, ensuring that rival political parties keep the current government in check.

Let's focus on ""The Land of The Free™"" compared to everywhere else.

The only real form of gambling in most areas is lottery, which is essentially a paper slot machine scam.

Let's look at the two scenarios:

With illegal gambling, instead of going to a public safe place to play cards like a casino, we all know that won't stop people, so they do it in secret, in possibly dangerous situations. Depending on the gambling, we've all seen movies, people can get straight up killed over it.

With Legal Gambling, it is played in safe areas with security, and if you lose, they go after you legally, not lethally.

There is **no negative effects**. It's a game. It's not hurting anyone else, fuck, it's not even hurting you. America is of the few with illegal gambling laws. Notice how the rest of the fucking world isn't imploding over fucking card games? If anything, I think it's false fucking advertisement that we claim to be ""the land of the free™"" but have these nonsense laws that literally put us below other countries in freedoms. The only thing this adds to the whole equation is actually ruining people's lives, similar to the drug situation. Oh you're **playing with fucking cards** and then **handing someone green paper**? That *totally* sounds like a reason for several years in jail, the loss of your job and life. Oh yeah, and a little tiny itty bitty thing it can add: Say you love poker and blackjack and all you want to do is go to a *real* casino. Well, you can't because you live in the middle of nowhere so I guess you're just too poor to do a thing you could literally do fucking anywhere.

They use this excuse ""it's to help gambling addicts"" well look at what a fucking shocker the outcome is, they're still out there, except they're playing government regulated almost-guaranteed-loss bullshit lottery, or they're being hunted by loan sharks.

This is something I've felt strongly about for a long time. You're good at sports? Money. You're good at video games? Money. You're good at cards? Well, if the World Poker Tournament is too far away, prison? Ffs way back in school the resource officer gave us, *children*, a lecture on why ""putting 10¢ on the table as a joke is still a federal offense"" give me a fucking break.

Mark drives his car everyday to commute. Mark is very responsible; he understands that driving a car brings the risk of getting into a car accident so he drives as perfectly as you could imagine. Never runs a red light, doesn’t speed, doesn’t drive under the influence, etc. 

One day, Mark is commuting to work just like he always does. He’s on the highway driving when he realizes that his brakes suddenly stop working. Unable to humanly react quick enough, he has an unlucky accident due to the sudden brakes malfunction and crashes into another car. 

In the other car is Joe. Due to the accident, Joe now has a severely damaged kidney. Joe’s kidney failure means that he will be dying soon (let’s say within a year) due to Mark’s direct actions. 

The government says that Mark must donate one of his kidneys to Joe. Why? Well, Mark knew the risk that came with driving. His direct actions have now led him to hold a significant role in whether or not Joe will continue living. 
The government states that Mark must donate the kidney since the donors life is not at risk, and Joe deserves to continue living. After all Joe has the potential to live a much longer life than he already has. 

By donating his kidney to Joe, a piece of Mark’s body is directly working to continue the life of Joe. Mark’s direct actions caused the accident, Joe deserves to continue living and should not be punished for Mark’s accident, and Mark must take responsibility for his actions by using his body to ensure that Joe can continue life. 

Likewise, Mary is a responsible women who loves to have sex. She knows that sex brings the risk of pregnancy. Because she’s responsible, Mary and her husband always use contraceptives. However, one unlucky day the contraceptives don’t work and now Mary is pregnant. 

Now she has a fetus as direct result of her actions. 

The government says that Mary must use her body to ensure that the fetus can continue its life. After all, by carrying the fetus, Mary does not have her life at risk and using a piece of her body will ensure the continuation of the fetus’ life. Mary’s direct actions caused the accident, and the fetus shouldn’t be punished for Mary’s accident. Mary must take responsibility for her actions by using her body to ensure that the fetus can continue its life. 

The only difference in both scenarios is that Mary is creating life with her actions. Still though, both scenarios regard two people whose direct but accidental actions put another living entity’s continuation of life at stake. Both people can ensure that the other entity continues life by using their bodies to directly affect them. Both people are being forced by their government to give up a piece of their body to let another body live.  


So how come in the real world, Mary should be forced to carry the baby to term while Mark isn’t forced to donate his kidney?

Going into a bathroom to wash your hands is more time consuming and forces you to touch handles and open doors.  Depending on the venue, location, etc., it also requires you to take your belongings with you or have someone look after them.  Having a more accessible sink would encourage hand washing before eating especially at places with no table service where you must pay first.  Overall it just seems more sanitary and would help establish hand washing as a practice before eating, especially in the company of others.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:  So my compromise is that the sink would not have to be in the eating area but could be farther removed, partitioned, as long as it's outside the bathrooms and anywhere where people wouldn't be obligated to enter the bathroom to wash their hands.

I'm advocating for a cultural shift not a law/code change, more like a market driven consumer preference than a mandate of any sort.  For the over-interpreters on here,  I am not ""demanding"" the industry cater to my ""whims"".  LOL.  I'm proposing an alternate set-up that would work better for a lot of people, including people with kids and people in wheelchairs.

This post was never about forcing or shaming anyone into washing their hands before eating though that could be a side-effect of locating an extra sink in an eatery.  Handiwipes and sanitizer goo would never work for me.  If it works for you, great.  I would never attempt to stand in the way of you using copious amounts and putting food in your mouth  right afterwards.

Going into a bathroom to wash your hands is more time consuming and forces you to touch handles and open doors.  Depending on the venue, location, etc., it also requires you to take your belongings with you or have someone look after them.  Having a more accessible sink would encourage hand washing before eating especially at places with no table service where you must pay first.  Overall it just seems more sanitary and would help establish hand washing as a practice before eating, especially in the company of others.&lt;/p&gt;

If the classroom had a large closet, we were told to sit in there.  This is just dumb.  

Firstly, I don't think that locking the doors, turning off the lights and barricading the doors are necessarily bad ideas, but I don't think that they are terribly effective.  I'm all for doing these things assuming you have the time to.

Secondly, I think that closing the blinds doesn't really help.  If someone was shooting a classroom, I would like the opportunity to break the window then jump out without getting tangled up in the blinds.  Even if it meant I had to jump from the 2nd or even 3rd floor.  I would much rather choose life over limb.  You could argue having the blinds open would make turning off the lights slightly redundant, and I would agree, but I think that the potential benefits outweigh the fairly low cost as I don't think having little light would be very effective.

Thirdly, having everyone sit in one corner of the classroom is the worst possible thing you could do in that situation.  With everyone seated in one cramped corner means that if the shooter comes in, it would be very hard to get away from them.  It will take a second or two to get up, and it gives the shooter a nice bunch of people to shoot at.  They are literally sitting ducks.  In the 5 seconds it would take for everyone to disperse, the shooter could have killed up to 10 or 15 people, depending on what kind of gun was used.  This would also make it so that the bodies of someone who was killed could be blocking the way or pinning someone down, preventing them from dispersing.

Finally, and this is probably the dumbest thing I heard in all of high school, students should not be sitting in a storage closet. All the drawbacks from the previous paragraph apply, but there is no where to escape to.  All the gunman has to do is open the door and start spraying bullets and they will kill everyone inside.

So what should be taught?  I would say that they should keep the blinds open and even open a window to allow people to escape.  They should allow those who wants to volunteer the opportunity to meet the shooter at the door with some sort of weapon, weather it be a stool, a fire extinguisher or something like that.  Maybe even keep a baseball bat or something like that in the classroom.  They should also teach students to spread out, making it harder for the gunman to shoot all of them.  They should teach the kids to throw stuff at the shooter as well, maybe a chair, a textbook or a rock.  If everyone threw something at him at the same time, it would definitely distract them and possibly slow them down.   These objects could also be used to break the window to escape.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when I was in high school, during lockdown drills, we were taught to lock the doors, close the blinds, turn off the lights, barricade the door and squat/sit/kneel in a corner along with 30 other kids.

However, in the global South, or put another way, the developing world, carbon emissions are increasing at a breakneck pace. This is especially true in China and recently India. Already, China is the number one carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide producer in the world. With their immense populations, if they reach a standard of living and commensurate carbon emissions per capita equivalent to those in the US or Western Europe or elsewhere in the global North, the consequences for the environment are difficult to overstate.

This will become true in Africa, as well. As their economies burgeon, their energy needs will expand. If they follow the same model as India and China, their carbon emissions will likewise balloon into unprecedented levels. Given that Africa is expected to reach a population of around 4 billion by the end of this century, if they reach carbon emissions per capita on par with, or even half of, those of the US at the present time, the consequences for the environment will again be difficult to overestimate.

In light of this, in a purely ~~utilitarian~~ (Edit:) selfish mindset devoid of considerations of morality or ethics, and instead focused purely on self-preservation and benefits to self, the best course of action for the US, and more broadly the global North, to take would be to engage in military force to cripple the economies of the countries in the global South, preferably without the use of nuclear weapons, while of course continuing to take other measures to reduce their own carbon emissions concurrently. This would mean devastating economic engines and centers in India and China, destroying as many power plants as possible, and then taking measures to actively prevent rebuilding those economic engines, or the development of more energy-demanding economies elsewhere in the global South.

If the global North wishes to maintain its standard of living, while at the same time preventing climate catastrophe, without consideration of moral qualms, the most effective way to do so right now would be to militarily stop the economic growth of the global South, and to continuously prevent its growth until such time as technology can be developed to completely mitigate carbon emissions and other pollutants.

# Important Definitions/Concepts

* **Carbon Tax:** a carbon tax is the core policy for reducing and eventually eliminating the use of fossil fuels whose combustion is destabilizing and destroying our climate.
   * In theory would tax companies based on the proportional amount of CO2 emissions they produce.
* **Carbon Chemistry:** The amount of CO2 released in burning any fossil fuel is strictly proportional to the fuel’s carbon content.
* **Energy Essence:** every fossil fuel's carbon and hydrogen atoms.
* **Upstream:** a term for the operations stages in the oil and gas industry that involve exploration and production.

&amp;#x200B;

# How would we implement a carbon tax?

Science has shown that we have the ability to know the precise levels of carbon content in every fossil fuel, meaning we can precisely measure the amounts of CO2 emissions every fossil fuel emits (ranging from coal to petroleum and much more). A carbon tax would be based directly off of these levels (and be proportional to them), making it simple to measure and document. Once the monetary proportions of these taxes has been figured out, it would be implemented in a very simple way. On the corporate level, upstream oil companies would be taxed based on the amount of CO2 emissions they produce each year (which they would be required to report), as would all other corporations (IE Amazon). Essentially, companies are taxed based on the amount of CO2 emissions they produce each year, proportionally.

There are also ideas of taxing the individual products a company makes that a consumer might buy:

1. Adding a carbon tax to the products a consumer purchases, based on the CO2 emissions of the company that made that product.
   1. **Example:** company A produces 10,000 pounds of CO2 each year, so pays a carbon tax of 3% on annual income. Due to this, the product of this company would also receive a 3% tax (so if it was priced at $100 it would now cost the consumer $103). *Note all numbers are entirely hypothetical and just used to illustrate the example for easy math. These numbers do not reflect the actual carbon tax in principle, but are rather used to better illustrate the example in the least complicated way possible. Additionally, this was intended to be a small scale example in the effort of easy math. In reality, there would likely be a much heftier tax on these companies.*
      1. **Explanation:** This form of a carbon tax would do two main things. It would incentivize the consumer to purchase products from a competitor of company A because the product is more expensive. Transitively, this would cause company A to lower their CO2 emissions to draw back consumers. Overall, the tax on the consumer would incentivize company A to lower their CO2 emissions to prevent a loss of customers.

These taxes would also take place on small businesses (though their carbon tax would naturally be much lower than that of a large corporation).

One example of a carbon tax:

$100/MT of CO2 for every major company.

Additionally, the point of the carbon tax would for it to be so high that it would actually encourage the companies to lower carbon emissions. Like the above plan (which many senators have proposed) would cost many fortune 500 companies 100's of millions of dollars, which would be so unaffordable they would be forced to lower carbon emissions to lower the taxes.

# When would we implement a carbon tax?

ASAP. Cannot stress this enough.

# Why should we implement a carbon tax?

*why* we should implement a carbon tax.

1. **The planet is dying and a carbon tax would be a huge start in reducing the United State's negative impact on dangerous climate change.** (It could reduce the USA's use of fossil fuels by as much as 60%-90%, according to several joint studies conducted in the last five years).
2. It is easily achievable (easy to enforce and regulate).
3. It would be a potential source of income for the government.
   1. This money could be sourced directly into other ways of fighting climate change.
4. It would create ""green jobs"" which would benefit the citizens and economy. (it is estimated that the average clean energy facility would have as much as 10,000 more jobs than a fossil fuel energy facility of the same scale. Implemented across America, this would create millions of jobs. Literally millions).
5. It's been effective in other countries.
6. It wouldn't have an extreme negative effect on the economy. (but global warming sure would)

&amp;#x200B;

# What about the economy?

If extreme taxes on fossil fuels did become a thing, then there would be a potential negative effect on the US economy. However, the effects on the economy are widely unknown (according to a series of studies conducted over the last five years. In fact, there is lots of evidence pointing towards the opposite). If we were to play ""devils advocate"" and assume that the economy would be negatively effected for a minimum of a few years, it would still be worth it for one simple reason: survival.

The point of the carbon tax isn't to create revenue for the US government (though that would be a positive side affect). The point is to drastically reduce carbon levels to protect the planet we live on (which it would accomplish).

*Note: I will* ***NOT*** *be debating climate change and the potentially disastrous effects it will have. Anybody who attempts to debate the effects of climate change will be ignored. I will not be debating years scientific studies.*

**TL;DR of this section:** ***IF*** **the economy were to be negatively effected, it would still be worth it to avoid disaster. Life and survival outweighs economic prosperity.**

&lt;p&gt;The point of the carbon tax isn&amp;#39;t to create revenue for the US government (though that would be a positive side affect). The point is to drastically reduce carbon levels to protect the planet we live on (which it would accomplish).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I will&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;be debating climate change and the potentially disastrous effects it will have. Anybody who attempts to debate the effects of climate change will be ignored. I will not be debating years scientific studies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR of this section:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;IF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;the economy were to be negatively effected, it would still be worth it to avoid disaster. Life and survival outweighs economic prosperity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

But my American self? Nothing, I grew up in America. Same town(hated it) elementary from 2nd grade through high school, was in little league, sports, big neighborhood… In high school (Where you can’t talk to your friend from down the street or neighbor anymore due to typical “high school politics”), I was a popular guy, known, felt I had decent friends for that time. Don’t speak to any of them, shoot, the friendship ended directly after high school concluded for all of them. I went to 3 different colleges. First was a commuter school(so, no friends, I understand), but my 2nd two were at prominent universities. Was in sports in one, and the other was in a fraternity, student council, government, many groups, clubs, etc. It’s only been 5 years, we went through a lot together, but I speak to no one. I go to the occasional wedding.

&amp;#x200B;

Now many of you may say it’s just “me” fair enough. But to clarify, I made it a point o stay a ""true friend"".  I Didn't have sex with anyone's girl, never hated on anyone, or tried to sabotage a career, never crapped on the friendship, stayed true. Always listened to 3am phone calls, etc.…I did at one point not call as much as I  was just going through a lot to make it, and during that time I lost all the friends I had. Known some for 10 years, 8, 6, 4 years, etc.…nothing. I’m a pretty charismatic guy, so making a friend isn’t that hard for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, the difference between my international or foreign friends compared to my American ones was that if it ever came to help with work, money, or career, no help at all was given(for American ones). Since it's 'competition"" that I never agreed to, or even realized, and on top of that, their friendships with minorities was just for a 'laugh' while in high school, see friends that had all African American friends in college, only 3 years after college and sports were over, be racist as fuck, to that race. When I knew their best friend in college, the one they lived with, helped them was that race or gender... Disgusted me. (This is common, not just for the white kids, but other minorities as well). My international friends if they had a friend of “insert race” here or group, they didn’t mince words and would seem to defend them, or at the very least, not go full blown the other way, when they weren’t there.

&amp;#x200B;

Americans aren’t good friends and I feel it’s due to the propaganda (""Full House"" families)  which is all a lie. I find that the only friends I keep, through the shit, and the storms, are the foreign ones, that moved to America, or visit a lot, those raised here are worthless friends for the most part.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, the treatment of their siblings is horrible. I can name about 1/10 families I know that they do not have intense sibling issues. The parents seem to fuel it, or let it happen. My American friends may have a weird brother or sister, and they just leave them with the wolves. To become weirdo's, losers, future or potential ""school shooters"" or shun them with their friends or group, my foreign or international friends are taught that family is 'everything', an even if their brother, or cousin, etc... is weird or not the norm, they try to include them, invite them, etc... at a way higher percentage and frequency than my American friends. I don’t see that much of the ""leaving them to the wolves"" in my international friends, they’ll always try and always include their “weird” brother or cousin.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, our obsession with drugs and  unhealthy food is since we all have emotional problems, and have no friends or even real ""family"", somehow America culture baits you into hating your siblings, or pushes them to hate you, every family is ""High Lander"" with the motto, ""there can be only one!"" and the parents raise that mentality to the detriment of their family. They raise that element, which I don't see in my international or foreign friends I made after age 27 years old... I'm closer with them than with any friend I knew from ages 1-18, and those I knew in college(18-25), funny how that works out? 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, change my view, are we raised to be crappy friends in America?  Do we have too much media influence, bad values taught in schooling, bad values all over that is not conducive at this time in society?

I do not hold the view that non-fictitious child pornography should be legalised (as will be explained below).

Also, I will be highlighting any statements which I feel are vital to my view and could be unfounded in **bold.** Debunk one or more of these statements, and my view will probably be changed.

**One of society's most critical goals is to protect the vulnerable. This should include protecting children from sexual abuse.** Therefore, we should work to minimise the number of children being sexually abused. **This goal is more important to society than other more abstract goals like cleanliness, freedom and order.**

However, before we can minimise a number, we must first know what that number is influenced by. In the case of the number of children suffering sexual abuse, it may be modelled a follows:

C~I*B(B(N,p),a)

Where C is the number of children suffering from sexual abuse, N is the world population, p is the chance that any individual person is a paedophile, a is the chance that any given paedophile will sexually abuse a child, I is the average number of children abused by any given abuser, and B(n,p) indicates a binomial distribution.

The mean of this distribution is C≈NpaI. As such, lowering p, a or I will reduce C, while increasing p, a or I will increase C. Reducing N is murder, which directly conflicts with the goal of protecting the vulnerable. As such, N may be treated as a constant.

Firstly, here are a couple of examples of how this model of child abuse helps influence my views on certain laws:

Active policing against child abuse. This will reduce I dramatically because an active paedophile can't abuse children if they're in jail. It will also reduce a dramatically due to the effects of deterrence: paedophiles may avoid harming children out of fear of getting caught. Further reductions in a and p will be caused by the presence of the police making paedophilia a taboo, as people will suppress fetishes and urges they see as unacceptable. There are no other significant effects on the number of children abused caused by actively policing against child abuse. Therefore, as p a and I are only decreasing, actively policing against child abuse reduces the number of children abused. It is therefore a good thing and should be allowed to exist.

Non-fictitious child pornography. This would cause a slight increase in p as discovering child porn may lead fetishes that would otherwise lay dormant to rear their ugly heads. There is also the copycat effect, which would increase a as people imitate what they see others doing. However, there is also the impact of laziness which must be considered. If given the choice between kidnapping and abusing a child (who will do a lot to resist) and going to a questionable website, most paedophiles will choose the path of least resistance, reducing a. Finally, I will increase because those uploading child porn will likely abuse more children in order to continue uploading content. The three effects increasing the number of children being abused outweigh the reduction in a caused by laziness, and there are no other significant effects on the number of children suffering sexual abuse caused by child pornography. Therefore, non-fictitious child pornography increases the number of children being abused. It is therefore a bad thing, and should not be allowed to exist.

Now, let's talk about the impacts of fictitious child pornography. Firstly, it would cause a slight increase in p as discovering child porn may lead fetishes that would otherwise lay dormant to rear their ugly heads. **However, this increase in p has an upper limit, as most people cannot be turned on by sexualised children.** Secondly, **the effects of laziness are still present. In fact, they're likely to be *even stronger* due to how fictitious characters aren't limited by the laws of physics, and can therefore provide more, cheaper content than non-fictitious child pornography. This will reduce a very dramatically!** It is also worth noting that **this will also reduce I, as non-fictitious child porn creators will be out-competed by their cheaper, more widely available counterparts. Most of them will therefore stop abusing children, as there's no more demand for the videos.** The copycat effect is a lot less dramatic than in the case of non-fictitious child pornography, if it even exists at all. This is because the human brain is very good at reading context, meaning that **being shown unacceptable behaviour in a fictitious context does not cause a person to repeat that behaviour in real life.** (Citation: M.H.Thomas, P.M.Tell: ""Effects of viewing real versus fantasy violence on interpersonal aggression"" Journal of Research in Personality vol. 8 issue 2, 1974 (pages 153-160)) **In total, the mitigating effects on a and I outweigh the aggravating effects on p and a,** meaning fictitious child pornography reduces the number of victims of child sexual abuse. It is therefore a good thing, and should be allowed to exist.

TL;DR: Fictitious child pornography should be legalised because it saves the lives of children who would otherwise be victims of sexual abuse.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I explain my view, I would like to place emphasis on the word &lt;strong&gt;fictitious&lt;/strong&gt; in the title.

The given mentality behind this distinction is that an idea should belong to someone for a set period of time after they think it, in order for them to get a fair chance at a competitive market. This way, they can theoretically engage in activities that would otherwise not be profitable.

To clarify: Labeling ideas as “public or private” is a completely artificial distinction intended to give people advantage at a “first come, first serve” basis, in order to encourage time spent inventing and discovering new ways to produce.

And, because the distinction is not based in any real measurements of any kind, the line between “public domain” and “private idea” is completely arbitrary. Honestly, it seems that they just sort of picked a number of years that seemed good and said “there ya go, sue anyone who doesn’t agree.”

Let’s say something is set to go public domain in 70 years... what is the difference between the day before that idea goes public and the day after? Or even the year before? Literally no difference, because ideas can’t be contained once you release them into the world. It is natural for ideas to spread— that’s what they do best.

The whole law is still a noble concept and all, hopefully intended to help the common people and protect them from being overrun by big business. It just isn’t justified by any concrete reasoning and so it isn’t really right or fair.

Hate speech: abusive or threatening speech or writing that expresses prejudice against a particular group, especially on the basis of race, religion, or sexual orientation.

We can acknowledge hate speech without legally restricting free speech. Acknowledging hate speech is not necessarily the same as advocating for or implementing laws that would restrict hate speech.

I believe that those who refuse to acknowledge that hate speech exists generally do so because they fear that by acknowledging it, they're giving a foothold to laws (and to a lesser extent policies by private entities) to ban certain speech. 

Raising the point ""but who decides what is hate speech?"" doesn't actually disprove the existence of hate speech. 

Appealing to the ""free market place of ideas"" doesn't disprove the existence of hate speech (and doesn't even guarantee that good ideas prevail over bad ideas. Good ideas being ones that have integrity and/or facilitate some goal and bad ideas being ones that lack integrity and/or don't facilitate some goal, or worse, is counter productive. By integrity I just mean ideas that are honest, rational, and objective).


We can more or less objectively evaluate whether some speech is hateful or not (both by looking at the connotation/definitions/context of the speech, but especially by observing the consequences). What speech should be banned, by who, where, when, why, and how is a different conversation. 

And if you must know, here is *my* position on free speech. I think it is very useful to think of free speech as generally the lesser of two evils (that is free speech for all, or free speech for some or no one). That is, I think a society that has free speech is generally better than one that doesn't, but I also acknowledge that free speech has a cost itself. 


After all, it's ridiculous to deny that speech has no consequences for society/individuals, if such were the case we would not ever desire to see the rise or decline of certain ideas. If enough people have hate for a group in society, it stands to reason that there will be increasingly adverse consequences for that group as hate for them increases (though the exact details depends on their position and numbers, as well as the position and numbers of those who hate them). 

It should be obvious, but I think a society with less hate speech is better as well.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you agree that there is such a thing as hate, then you must necessarily agree that there is such a thing as hateful.&lt;/p&gt;

I think it is very useful to think of free speech as generally the lesser of two evils (that is free speech for all, or free speech for some or no one). That is, I think a society that has free speech is generally better than one that doesn&amp;#39;t, but I also acknowledge that free speech has a cost itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, it&amp;#39;s ridiculous to deny that speech has no consequences for society/individuals, if such were the case we would not ever desire to see the rise or decline of certain ideas. If enough people have hate for a group in society, it stands to reason that there will be increasingly adverse consequences for that group as hate for them increases (though the exact details depends on their position and numbers, as well as the position and numbers of those who hate them). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be obvious, but I think a society with less hate speech is better as well.&lt;/p&gt;

My basic thinking here is that converting more minor streets to bus-only would create effective rapid routes which are currently impossible even with dedicated bus lanes, because dedicated bus lanes are violated so frequently.

Currently the city uses red painted lanes on major routes (e.g. 34th street, 1st avenue).  I would replace these with dedicated streets where appropriate.  I don't think there's a good right-of-way for an uptown/downtown route though so you'd be stuck with painted lanes there, though for the 15 bus you might bus-only at least some of its downtown portion since it provides important north-south connections and faces huge delays in lower manhattan.

There are also likely other routes where you could bus-only more minor parallel streets as an alternative to buses on major avenues, though for geography reasons it's not always possible (e.g. the heavily used B46 in Brooklyn seems impossible to do this for because it often loses parallel streets to lack of bridges or other street plan changes, likewise 110th/CPN is the only full crosstown street in that area due to Morningside Park, so it's important to run on 110th and not 111th.

However, here's what I don't get: healthy humans can change their circadian rythms. We can change them by about an hour or so in one day. That's how people who go to a different time zone adjust. Their circadian rythm shifts to match the new time zone.

So... you can do that in the same time zone. If you want to wake up earlier, go to sleep earlier. However, if your usual bedtime is 2 AM and you go to sleep at 10 PM, yeah you'll have a rough time and stare at the ceiling a long while. However, in a few days, if you stick to it, you'll be able to fall asleep.

Now, if someone needs darkness, can't they just use a mask? And if they need light to wake up, blast bright blue light from a screen to do that?

That's what I did- I'm not much of a morning person, but with a consistent bedtime (when possible, work/life can interfere) and a sleep mask, I wake up without an alarm clock at 5-6 with no problems. I go to bed at ~10 PM.

So, I really don't understand people who complain they just can't go to sleep earlier. Just tough out the first few days, then you adjust.

Now, I don't include shift workers, people with sleep disorders, or other medical issues that can impact sleep, because those are a different ball game.

Should every country that abuses human rights face an American invasion? 

B) The Confederacy would compete with the Union in expanding westward. Allowing secession would not change the path America was on of stealing native land and expanding ever-westward.

&amp;#x200B;

About a hundred years ago when the car was invented, many people wanted to ban them from cities. You could argue that that was because cars were very unsafe and people are just afraid of new technology in general. Well, I think those people were actually completely right, and the only reason they didn't get their way was money. Life is better without cars being a [necessity](https://www.curbed.com/2017/5/17/15649210/car-free-places-city-island).

&amp;#x200B;

The automobile was a fantastic advance in technology that remains one of the best options for certain kinds of travel or business. However, for a regular person who just wants to get around town, they're HORRIBLE. I'll list my points in numbers to make it easier.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Land used for parking lots and wide roads is a waste

Imagine all the wide paved roads narrowed and 0 parking lots exist. Everywhere is basically an out door mall completely walkable or bikable. A trolley goes by carrying passengers from their homes to their offices on the other side of town. The land used for parking lots and huge roads is extremely wasteful and if they didn't exist you could just walk, bike, or trolley.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Traffic didn't have to be reality

That hour long commute to the other side of town could have been a 30 minute trolley ride where you get to read or work on your way to the office. Traffic is a completely self inflicted wound on humanity and I hope future generations will start to build more walkable cities with better public transportation. Traffic is such a waste of our short time on this planet and it genuinely makes our lives worse.

&amp;#x200B;

3. You would still be able to get your groceries or your lumber home just fine

What about my groceries? What about my shopping spree at the home depot? I imagine those businesses would have home delivery services that still would have been exponentially more cheap than owning a car.  Even if they used trucks that drove behind the trolleys, it would have been a better society than every person needing to own a car. For groceries, home delivery or a [push cart](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ORinw%2BxCL._SX425_.jpg) would be just fine.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Life would be so much easier for the disabled

In a city where you can push your wheel chair from store to store without traversing dangerous intersections and time consuming parking lots would be a great city. On my bus I see people with wheel chairs and walkers all the time and they can use the bus just fine. That would also be about $7000 to $10,000 a year they could spend on medical bills or bionic legs.

&amp;#x200B;

5. People would have an extra $7000 - $10,000 and beyond more money a year

With that amount of money per car owner are you really surprised that the car was marketed and implemented the way it has been? It makes perfect sense that a dense city and even less dense town would be built for walking or riding the trolley but that's not profitable.

&amp;#x200B;

6. So many deaths could have been avoided

[1.25 million people die in road crashes each year](https://www.asirt.org/safe-travel/road-safety-facts/). Come on, surly that alone is an argument for walkable cities with trolleys &amp; trains that come every 3 minutes, right?

&amp;#x200B;

7. More exercise

Some of you reading this may have a gym membership they haven't used in a while or at least wish you could find a way to burn more calories throughout the day. Imagine being able to walk from your home to a friend's in very little time and also pulling your groceries home, bada bing bada boom.

&amp;#x200B;

8. Environmental impact

We all know this one, next.

&amp;#x200B;

9. What about jobs?? Car salesmen and mechanics!

There would still be cars and a need for salesmen of cars. It wouldn't be as much, but I'll argue that the deaths of people each year from cars out number the job loss of people who could probably just become plumbers which we have a [shortage of](https://waterworkplumbing.com/qualified-plumber-job-shortage/) anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

10. What about road trips and camping trips!

Cars are still a valid form for certain kinds of transportation needs. I imagine some road trips would have been train trips complete with mingling with other travelers and dining services but whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

11. I love cars though!!

I do too, one of my bucket list items is riding in a [semi-limo](http://www.thebiggestlimo.com/images/olympus-02.jpg). In my scenario, anybody who wants to own a car can still own a car. You can still be the car-guy/gal. But for the rest of us, we don't want to have to have a car, I want to spend that time and money on something else. There'd probably be a way to get your car from the edge of the city to your home and back or it would be stored at the edge of the city, I don't know I'm not a civil planner but I'm sure there's be a perfectly fine solution.

&amp;#x200B;

12. How would stores stock their shelves??

Humans are extremely innovative and intelligent creatures. Had cars been banned in cities, there'd still be ways for trucks to get to the back of the walmart. There'd still be ways for UPS to deliver your packages. I'm not a civil engineer, I don't know exactly what that looks like. But I know that the people who have sat around coming up with brilliant ways to implement cars into cities could have instead spent their time on that. I'd even argue that it would be much easier for small business to thrive. When I go to the 16th st mall here in Denver, I see more small businesses than anywhere else and the free mall ride gets everyone where they need to go.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion

It's easy to see why the car was imposed upon society. They're extremely profitable and dealerships are honestly [dynasties](https://www.autonews.com/article/20160606/OEM02/306069977/family-ties-the-dynasties-of-the-auto-industry) that are keeping those families rich at the cost of keeping our families [poor](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2015/1/20/the-negative-consequences-of-car-dependency). [Electric cars have been around for over a century](https://www.energy.gov/timeline/timeline-history-electric-car) and yet we still use gas powered because *money.* It's always been about money.

&amp;#x200B;

From nearly the beginning it was about revolutionizing a way to get into your wallet, not to make your life better.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: see point 12. for how stores would get their goods&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;d even argue that it would be much easier for small business to thrive. When I go to the 16th st mall here in Denver, I see more small businesses than anywhere else and the free mall ride gets everyone where they need to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy to see why the car was imposed upon society. They&amp;#39;re extremely profitable and dealerships are honestly &lt;a href=""https://www.autonews.com/article/20160606/OEM02/306069977/family-ties-the-dynasties-of-the-auto-industry""&gt;dynasties&lt;/a&gt; that are keeping those families rich at the cost of keeping our families &lt;a href=""https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2015/1/20/the-negative-consequences-of-car-dependency""&gt;poor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=""https://www.energy.gov/timeline/timeline-history-electric-car""&gt;Electric cars have been around for over a century&lt;/a&gt; and yet we still use gas powered because &lt;em&gt;money.&lt;/em&gt; It&amp;#39;s always been about money.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

1. Prostitution is the consensual exchange of goods and services for money. It is no different than paying someone for a massage. Paying somebody for sexual services is no different than any other exchange of goods (when the person is consenting, of course)
2. It is a waste of time for police officers to track down and arrest prostitutes (because there are loads of more serious crimes that need more attention)
3. Prostitution laws end up harming sex workers (IE, in lots of cases, those forced in to sex work) [1](https://law.yale.edu/ghjp/projects/gender-sexuality-and-rights/protecting-health-and-rights-sex-workers-us-and-globally), NOTE: prostitution laws meaning those that make it illegal. 
   1. Reasoning:
      1.  Criminal prostitution means women cant call the cops if they are harmed, can't force the John's to wear protection, have no protections against pimps, are more likely to succumb to drugs and STIs, more likely live un unsafe areas, are forced to perform in unsafe places like alleys, are more exposed to violence, risk unsafe abortions, and overall means more crime, more spread of disease, poorer economic performance, more ghettos, less police presence, kids growing up in unsafe situations and more sex trafficking, less ability to say no to things like minors drugs bestiality or forced pornography.
      2. Legalised prostitution means women can be licenced (more government money) and undergo health testing and treatment (less government money spent on health issues). The women can call the cops if they need help, choose safer less aggressive johns, enforce safe sex, pay taxes, boost the economy, set their own prices, get out from under pimps and sex traffickers, choose safer places to practice, advertise their services, accept non-cash payment which is safer, require id's which is safer, can say no to other illegal things like working for/as minors, can lobby the government, get off the streets, access birth control, condoms, and safe abortions, and even contribute to their communities.

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, I don't really see any reason it should be *illegal*. It just seems like an unnecessary crime.

The person who benefits from mass transportation is the passenger.  This seems like an obvious and indisputable premise.  And so it seems to make sense to charge a fare so that passengers pay for the bulk (or the entirety) of the cost of running a mass transportation system.

But I don't think that's true.  In many large cities (the New Yorks, the Chicagos, the Londons and Tokyos), the city *cannot function* unless people use mass transportation.  It's simply impossible to move the number of people that need to be moved without a mass transportation system.  

In that way, mass transportation is much closer to police services (city-wide charge) than something like water (charge per unit consumed).  Even though some people might ""consume"" police or fire services more than others, we recognize that metered (or fared) consumption is a poor way to distribute costs for that kind of city service.  

Another way to think about it.  One way to allocate costs is by allocating it on the entities that impose the cost.  If you use a lot of water the city will charge you more because you impose a greater cost than someone who draws less water.  if you consumed less water then you would be charged less.  If everyone consumed less (or opted out completely, maybe a private water supplier), then the city could scale back its system and spending.

I argue that it would massively increase costs to the point of failure for the city.  Why would users switching away from a city service *increase* costs to the city?  Because the users are providing a *benefit* to the city by taking mass transportation (generally speaking).

Not all mass transportation use benefits the city.  But the system as a whole is so critical to the functioning of a large city that I think it's incorrect to place the burden of maintaining the system on the subset of the population who aren't fortunate enough to be able to opt out of it (such as by driving, or living near more expensive commercial centers).","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: Free at point of entry meaning no fares/tickets.

What is *'this'*? Whatever it is (and given *""it is what it is""*) it ain't what it ain’t by proxy. That is to say, if *this* is a 'this' then anything not *’this’* must be that. This is a fundamental principle of difference within descriptive language to differentiate between things - and as language forms perspective to foster perception, we need to return to this base-level analysis of difference between the 'I' and 'The Other' and build back up to make this point.

You are you and there's no one else like it - and this is good. You are an individual and possess unique individuality. You are the smallest possible unit of society, so whilst you may find affiliation with some label or other (racially, culturally, nationally, sexually, etc.) these group identities/labels can never represent you as they exclude too much through the attempt in defining the label - e.g. ""blackness is..."" or ""whiteness is..."" which are absolutely ridiculous attempts to define an individual characteristic through a prism of affiliation to something bigger than the individual that then binds them to it. That is to say, when we attempt to define ourselves as anything other than 'I' we will always fail in the attempt. That being said we are capable of defining abstractions and agreeing upon these collectively, (Plato would define these as 'essences') such as mathematics or measurement-terms (inches, degrees Celsius etc.) - just making this point to be pre-emptive.

**Equality**  
There are a few attempts to produce equality within the systems we inhabit and give credence to, however none of them can be wholly successful beyond a given point of what I will call an '*agreed level of failure'* in that none are successful though we loosely agree that the attempt for it is noble (whereas I believe notions of nobility prevent ignorance in the actions of attempt). Let's look at some of the attempts at equality we put forward:

*Equality of Opportunity* - The belief that each individual human should be able to attempt to seek value in whatever they choose no matter their environment or born traits, relying solely on their merit and ability to gain success once within a given field (i.e. able to compete but accepting there will be inequality in competition/ability once entry is gained to the field).

*Equality of Outcome* – The belief that the resulting ‘power structures’ we have in the present are biased towards a given [insert group label here] and must be forcefully restructured to produce more/better equality. The usual culprits and reasoning for the bias are things like differences in ethnicity or sex (irrespective of ability) and usually buttressed by the claims of certain historical context. Very often it is the claim that those holding the power now do not relinquish it therefore there needs to be a forceful (legislative) adjustment to the hierarchy to redistribute the demographic of power-holding equally among the group orientations required to satisfy the identitarian goal (i.e. there is no requirement to compete/be the best as there is acceptance that the position of the competition is inherently unfair, therefore legislation/policy changes the method of selection).

*Equality of Law* - The belief that each citizen under a government has equal rights when compared to any other citizen (regardless of sex, age or race).

**Assumption of Inequality in Nature**  
Are you a man or a woman? Whichever you are, consider yourself and compare yourself to your fellow sex. Are you equal to them in totality? Of course not - there is no intra-sex equality; a man is not equal to all men and a woman is not equal to all women.

Therefore, at a base-level of sex difference and intra-sex analysis, we are not equal and as such can hope for no equality between the sexes (inter-sex). Of course, this latter statement should be a perfectly reasonable thing to say given our sexual dimorphism (and which is the same for many other species').  

**Failures of 'Equality' programmes**  
*Opportunity* - It should require no evidence to make the claim that those who have the ability to *do* are more capable of doing what they want and therefore success in that field increases. 

This has many applications. Economic differences produce a difference in education quality. Geographic differences produce a difference in availability of services. Genetic differences produce differences in mental acuity or physical prowess. Familial differences produce a difference in upbringing - and so on.

Ultimately, no one may ‘finish’ the same because no one truly ‘starts’ the same. This is not to say that avenues are barred (they are open) but that the difficulty of achievement (when considering the multiple variables going into the choice of an action) means the attempt of achieving equality in this manner is done in good faith - and I agree that it should be attempted - however it remains inherently impossible because we are born from different people in different places at different times etc.

*Outcome* - Equality of outcome is nothing more than an usurpation of national selection (in terms of merit/ability) to restructure a hierarchy so that the *presently* ostracised are elevated to a position of power based (mostly) on there being a lack of a given group label in the name of diversity (female, black, brown, Asian, gay, etc.)

This method is excluding. The function for a structure of competency (hierarchy) is to elevate the best in ability to a position of competency and increased responsibility, therefore elevating those who are untested within this process means that there *will be* a detrimental effect on the ability of the hierarchy as a whole as it will sacrifice ability (along with flexibility and strength) for the appearance and theory that equal [insert category here] across all results in a *better* outcome in terms of product &amp; effect.

Ultimately, the biggest problem with an outcome-based system of equality is that it is theory-heavy - and as theory is an academic pursuit (and moves/morphs faster than social selection) - most of the concepts and ""new words"" (privilege, unconscious bias, white-guilt, diversity, racism, Islamist, fascism, Alt-Right) do not hold their modern parlance and are disruptive and incongruent. The clash of interpretations leads to a power-dynamic whereby the producer of the word(s) label their opponents as the re-branded concept to beat them in terms of word-play to wrest power. This feels dishonourable as it suggests (to me) that they reinvent ""the rules"" with theory so that the outcome is beneficial to the re-inventor and is essentially a weapon.

*Law* - Equality of law is not something that exists at extreme ends (such as women's reproductive rights vs. men's reproductive rights). This is stated to emphasise the notion of inherent *difference* in terms of sexual dimorphism within society and all that goes along with that, so therefore the laws surrounding these 'different sexes' must be different or affect others unequally. In other words - this system to produce equality *cannot* produce equality (because equality is untenable) so it must treat unequal things unequally in order to be *more* equal. This reminds me of *Aristotle* - ""The worst form of inequality is to try to make unequal things equal"".

**Summary**  
The distinction of difference within language (and on a metaphysical level) is one of difference; the language we use to be distinct between things assumes difference from the get go of being conscious. The most fundamental division of the self from nature is ‘I’ and ‘Other’ with every ‘other’ being different.

There is no intra-sex equality, which is something reflected in the animal kingdom. There is no equality in nature over any category of comparison (this stands true the further down in measurement we go, as specificity is confounded by ever more precise measurement).

The approaches we employ to produce equality are all insufficient and ultimately fail as they are not complete; any theory of how something should be (aside from abstract definitions) are nothing but 'theory' and 'theory' =/= reality, so imposing theory on reality with indifference is damaging. One final note is to say that **no system** can be all encompassing enough to produce everything it intends to (without producing more problems). As such we should abandon the notion that equality is achievable *in theory* and accept that necessary difference is a fact of consciousness - and as such inequality (individuality) should be celebrated because it is through difference we have what we have. After all, we celebrate geniuses and the creations they bring (geniuses are unequal and distinct from ‘the norm’).

**TL;DR** - Equality doesn't exist in nature - for example - everything that now 'is' and which came from nothing is inherently unequal - equality suggests equilibrium whereas our state of being (existence in the universe) as well as within every gain we have made in every field is due to celebrated *inequality*, as this produces a gradient that forces change. Equality is not possible so we should cease attempting to force it (because it's damaging and destabilising). We should instead accept individualism and humility in our abilities and ambitions. We should be happy and content to be associated as 'I' and not with some group (where we believe power lies with) to inflate a sense of inequality towards other groups or a notion of equality within a chosen group.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This &amp;amp; That // Yin &amp;amp; Yang&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
What is &lt;em&gt;&amp;#39;this&amp;#39;&lt;/em&gt;? Whatever it is (and given &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;it is what it is&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;) it ain&amp;#39;t what it ain’t by proxy. That is to say, if &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is a &amp;#39;this&amp;#39; then anything not &lt;em&gt;’this’&lt;/em&gt; must be that. This is a fundamental principle of difference within descriptive language to differentiate between things - and as language forms perspective to foster perception, we need to return to this base-level analysis of difference between the &amp;#39;I&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;The Other&amp;#39; and build back up to make this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are you and there&amp;#39;s no one else like it - and this is good. You are an individual and possess unique individuality. You are the smallest possible unit of society, so whilst you may find affiliation with some label or other (racially, culturally, nationally, sexually, etc.) these group identities/labels can never represent you as they exclude too much through the attempt in defining the label - e.g. &amp;quot;blackness is...&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;whiteness is...&amp;quot; which are absolutely ridiculous attempts to define an individual characteristic through a prism of affiliation to something bigger than the individual that then binds them to it. That is to say, when we attempt to define ourselves as anything other than &amp;#39;I&amp;#39; we will always fail in the attempt. That being said we are capable of defining abstractions and agreeing upon these collectively, (Plato would define these as &amp;#39;essences&amp;#39;) such as mathematics or measurement-terms (inches, degrees Celsius etc.) - just making this point to be pre-emptive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
There are a few attempts to produce equality within the systems we inhabit and give credence to, however none of them can be wholly successful beyond a given point of what I will call an &amp;#39;&lt;em&gt;agreed level of failure&amp;#39;&lt;/em&gt; in that none are successful though we loosely agree that the attempt for it is noble (whereas I believe notions of nobility prevent ignorance in the actions of attempt). Let&amp;#39;s look at some of the attempts at equality we put forward:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Equality of Opportunity&lt;/em&gt; - The belief that each individual human should be able to attempt to seek value in whatever they choose no matter their environment or born traits, relying solely on their merit and ability to gain success once within a given field (i.e. able to compete but accepting there will be inequality in competition/ability once entry is gained to the field).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Equality of Outcome&lt;/em&gt; – The belief that the resulting ‘power structures’ we have in the present are biased towards a given [insert group label here] and must be forcefully restructured to produce more/better equality. The usual culprits and reasoning for the bias are things like differences in ethnicity or sex (irrespective of ability) and usually buttressed by the claims of certain historical context. Very often it is the claim that those holding the power now do not relinquish it therefore there needs to be a forceful (legislative) adjustment to the hierarchy to redistribute the demographic of power-holding equally among the group orientations required to satisfy the identitarian goal (i.e. there is no requirement to compete/be the best as there is acceptance that the position of the competition is inherently unfair, therefore legislation/policy changes the method of selection).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Equality of Law&lt;/em&gt; - The belief that each citizen under a government has equal rights when compared to any other citizen (regardless of sex, age or race).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assumption of Inequality in Nature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Are you a man or a woman? Whichever you are, consider yourself and compare yourself to your fellow sex. Are you equal to them in totality? Of course not - there is no intra-sex equality; a man is not equal to all men and a woman is not equal to all women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, at a base-level of sex difference and intra-sex analysis, we are not equal and as such can hope for no equality between the sexes (inter-sex). Of course, this latter statement should be a perfectly reasonable thing to say given our sexual dimorphism (and which is the same for many other species&amp;#39;).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failures of &amp;#39;Equality&amp;#39; programmes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Opportunity&lt;/em&gt; - It should require no evidence to make the claim that those who have the ability to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; are more capable of doing what they want and therefore success in that field increases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has many applications. Economic differences produce a difference in education quality. Geographic differences produce a difference in availability of services. Genetic differences produce differences in mental acuity or physical prowess. Familial differences produce a difference in upbringing - and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, no one may ‘finish’ the same because no one truly ‘starts’ the same. This is not to say that avenues are barred (they are open) but that the difficulty of achievement (when considering the multiple variables going into the choice of an action) means the attempt of achieving equality in this manner is done in good faith - and I agree that it should be attempted - however it remains inherently impossible because we are born from different people in different places at different times etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outcome&lt;/em&gt; - Equality of outcome is nothing more than an usurpation of national selection (in terms of merit/ability) to restructure a hierarchy so that the &lt;em&gt;presently&lt;/em&gt; ostracised are elevated to a position of power based (mostly) on there being a lack of a given group label in the name of diversity (female, black, brown, Asian, gay, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method is excluding. The function for a structure of competency (hierarchy) is to elevate the best in ability to a position of competency and increased responsibility, therefore elevating those who are untested within this process means that there &lt;em&gt;will be&lt;/em&gt; a detrimental effect on the ability of the hierarchy as a whole as it will sacrifice ability (along with flexibility and strength) for the appearance and theory that equal [insert category here] across all results in a &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; outcome in terms of product &amp;amp; effect.&lt;/p&gt;

On an individual level, laws exist because we've surrendered power to governments. The government can regulate my behavior because millions of people agree it can. So there is a force that is strong enough to compel me to act or not to act a certain way.

For countries, there are 195 (give or take depending on what breakaways you recognize) countries with disparate interests, varying levels of power, and probably a pretty low desire in general to go to war. 

China can complain that we break international law all they want, but unless they want to start a shooting war with us there isn't much they can do to change that. They can appeal to the UN or the Hague, and we can still basically tell them to buzz off.

So, I understand that it's made some crazy predictions but I also see a fair few discrepencies with the values held in taking down corruption. 

I'll try and keep it simple so well focus on the muller investigation. 

So Q declared that there was never anything, no corruption or collusion or anything and that it was a scheme from the deep state  

As were all probably aware muller himself came out and rightfully verified that there was 'not enough evidence' to make the call rather than what barr and trump echoed as innocent and squeaky clean. 
This wasn't really the case, there were instances of private meetings with Russian officials, him not filling out Miller's questions, it's documented that he was saved from futher crimes because his officials just didn't carry out his orders and let's not forget that he genuinely announced it would be the end of his presidency when he found out muller was investigating. 

You also may or may not remeber Q exclaimed that it was muller and trump working together in 2018. 
There was conspiracy of Russian officials interfearing with the 2016 election. According to Q this was another ploy by the democrats to frame trump in a bad way and use it to hide their wrong doings. 
This actually turned out to be the case, it was found that online russain operatives used social media to plant conspiracy theories to sway the election, since then trump has also confirmed that he had 'nothing to do with russia helping him win the election'. 

This is important because it shows vladamir putins old and continuous ambition to undermine our america democray (the flow of comunication that allows people to make a decition together) as his government is basically a dictatorship with their media staging different things to make him look good, people being killed if that disagree (including his opposition), North Korean song vibes it's fucking weird.
So far we have all seen and endured a big shift in our political system, people's views growing futher apart and the inability to discuss with the other side. 

This manifests in trumps ""fake news agenda"". 
This has holes in it for a few reasons, firstly his news network aka fox has been declared his favourite so many times. We all know how much he loves fox. The reporters have featured in his campaigns alot, its owned by rupert murdoch (currently owns all of australias media and it is objectivley and notoriously bias).This is Chummy relationship is especially shown when he lashes at fox of that report badly about him. 

Now I'm not saying what they serve is any political bias, but you have to consider the implications of them being so close. People are supposed to be able.to.trust the news to give them the information they need to vote. 
But when you have sean hanidy getting on stage at a rally or while reporting saying you guys need to vote.for.trump. 
I mean I don't know what to tell you, that is bias. 

So then I ask my self, that by trumps logic basically every other news network is complete bias so we should only listen to fox... but it's blaintantly bias.

My running theory is based on all this and more is that Q is russain officials that are supporting/communicating with trump to try and manipulate his supporters into only listening to his properganda. 
In turn this will devide us futher as the common ground becomes increasingly difficult to find between the 2 parties.

I think the fundamental premise that this rests on is that home ownership creates multi-generational wealth. Meaning, if my grand parents received a government subsidized home loan in the post-war era (which they did) it allowed for their children to get educated in better school districts in a more affluent area than one that was predominantly renters, that the appreciation in value for home ownership is bestowed on children, who reinvest that equity in their children through a reinforcing effect of that initial investment. The opposite is also true, that denial of access to subsidized loans forced many Americans into high-poverty neighborhoods or into long-term rental situations which prevented them from earning the same equity that whites were enabled to do. That if we constructed such a system based on other prerequisites, say denying all citizens of Florida access to federal housing programs out of some dystopic federal impunity, it would immediately be struck down as unconstitutional on various conditions, but because of hardened racism in the 40s and through the 1990s (in some places) African-Americans were legally prevented from such access to federally subsidized housing programs.

See: [Redlining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining) (Note: Keep in mind the FHA, FHLB and HOLC are government entities) 

From The Color of Law

&gt;From 1940 to 1945, the influx of war workers resulted in Richmond's \[California\] population exploding from 24,000 to more than 100,000. Richmond's black population soared from 270 to 14,000...  
&gt;  
&gt;With such rapid population growth, housing could not be put up quickly enough. The federal government stepped in with public housing.   
&gt;  
&gt;For white workers the federal government created a ""war guest"" program in which it leased spare rooms from white families so workers could move in as tenants. The government also issues low-interest loans for white home owners to remodel and sub-divide their residences.  
&gt;  
&gt;...with fewer private options\*, \[African Americans\] were more dependent on public housing than whites, the Richmond Housing Authority's segregated projects did less to alleviate the housing shortage for African Americans that for whites.  
&gt;  
&gt;\*Because the federal government refused to insure bank loans to African Americans for housing, standard construction was unaffordable.

Summary from The Color of Law (pg21)

In 1935 the New Deal PWA program demolished an integrated community adjacent to downtown Atlanta that was home to 1600 families. It remade the neighborhood with 604 whites-only homes. It intensified segregation in Atlanta as well as evicting black families who were forced into more segregated, poorer communities because of the denial of access to home loans. The PWA likewise did this in Detroit, Indianapolois, Toledo and New York City.

Getting kind of long so I'll wrap up, but there are similar incidents in 1976 in Chicago to the above example from the New Deal era. Likewise in Detroit in the 50s and 60s - best explained by reading the Origins of the Urban Crisis - and also in Boston in the 1980s, as explained in Color of Law. I say this to point out that this was not an artifact of the pre-Civil Rights Act era and in fact continued long after. 

**Addendum:** The end of Color of Law brings up several common questions and critiques and answers them so I'll do that here instead of tackling them when they inevitably get brought up in a comment.

* That was in the past, we can't be judged by their racism and standards now. We can't be held accountable for leaders in the past who did not have our standards.
   * During the New Deal era, Harold Ickes refused to segregate programs that fell under his purview and forcibly integrated CCC camps that operated on National Parks, where all other CCC camps were segregated or banned blacks. Eleanor Roosevelt also opposed the segregated New Deal programs and event joined the NAACP. So clearly not ALL leaders of that time were racists, they COULD have known better because other people did at their time.
* My family arrived here after the 1960s, I can't be made the pay higher taxes for the sins of the past. Alternatively, my family was opposed to segregation and marched in the Civil Rights era, why should I sacrifice to correct what we opposed then?
   * Americans long dead fought to establish this country and you share in those benefits even though your ancestors did not live here at that time. Also, you share in the benefits created by those segregated programs and so you must also share in the costs.
* There are all-Jewish, all-Italian, all-Mexican neighborhoods all over this country, are you saying everyone was forced to live that way and no one choose to live with like-minded people for access to similar churches, grocery stores, etc? Are you saying we should forcibly integrate those neighborhoods that exist today?
   * No one should be forced into particular neighborhoods, that's the whole point. But to deny that African Americans were forced into certain neighborhoods is a-historical. Yes, some people may choose to stay in segregated neighborhoods for certain conveniences, but African Americans to this day face barriers to integrating white neighborhoods (they are stopped or followed by police more often, their children are more likely to be punished in school for behavior that white students are not, their children are also more likely to not be seen as ""capable"" for difficult classes or activities).
* Don't black people share some responsibility for their own success? Crime rates are high in black neighborhoods, so whites are justified in resisting integration. Doesn't black ghetto culture have to change before we address this disparity?
   * Everyone, black, white, Hispanic, etc should share responsibility for their success. It is undeniable though that black students and homeowners have to work ""twice as hard"" to succeed and this does pay off, it's less than the payoff for whites. As pointed out in ""The New Jim Crow"" African Americans are less likely to use or sell drugs than whites but they are more likely to be arrested for use or sale and once arrested, continuously re-arrested and imprisoning nonviolent offenders in low-income neighborhoods has a multi-generational effect by removing one parent from the home.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt; I work in housing and this CMV is exclusively about housing policy and discrimination.

That if we constructed such a system based on other prerequisites, say denying all citizens of Florida access to federal housing programs out of some dystopic federal impunity, it would immediately be struck down as unconstitutional on various conditions, but because of hardened racism in the 40s and through the 1990s (in some places) African-Americans were legally prevented from such access to federally subsidized housing programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See: &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining""&gt;Redlining&lt;/a&gt; (Note: Keep in mind the FHA, FHLB and HOLC are government entities) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From The Color of Law&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1940 to 1945, the influx of war workers resulted in Richmond&amp;#39;s [California] population exploding from 24,000 to more than 100,000. Richmond&amp;#39;s black population soared from 270 to 14,000...  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With such rapid population growth, housing could not be put up quickly enough. The federal government stepped in with public housing.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For white workers the federal government created a &amp;quot;war guest&amp;quot; program in which it leased spare rooms from white families so workers could move in as tenants. The government also issues low-interest loans for white home owners to remodel and sub-divide their residences.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...with fewer private options*, [African Americans] were more dependent on public housing than whites, the Richmond Housing Authority&amp;#39;s segregated projects did less to alleviate the housing shortage for African Americans that for whites.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Because the federal government refused to insure bank loans to African Americans for housing, standard construction was unaffordable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary from The Color of Law (pg21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1935 the New Deal PWA program demolished an integrated community adjacent to downtown Atlanta that was home to 1600 families. It remade the neighborhood with 604 whites-only homes. It intensified segregation in Atlanta as well as evicting black families who were forced into more segregated, poorer communities because of the denial of access to home loans. The PWA likewise did this in Detroit, Indianapolois, Toledo and New York City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting kind of long so I&amp;#39;ll wrap up, but there are similar incidents in 1976 in Chicago to the above example from the New Deal era. Likewise in Detroit in the 50s and 60s - best explained by reading the Origins of the Urban Crisis - and also in Boston in the 1980s, as explained in Color of Law. I say this to point out that this was not an artifact of the pre-Civil Rights Act era and in fact continued long after. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addendum:&lt;/strong&gt; The end of Color of Law brings up several common questions and critiques and answers them so I&amp;#39;ll do that here instead of tackling them when they inevitably get brought up in a comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That was in the past, we can&amp;#39;t be judged by their racism and standards now. We can&amp;#39;t be held accountable for leaders in the past who did not have our standards.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the New Deal era, Harold Ickes refused to segregate programs that fell under his purview and forcibly integrated CCC camps that operated on National Parks, where all other CCC camps were segregated or banned blacks. Eleanor Roosevelt also opposed the segregated New Deal programs and event joined the NAACP. So clearly not ALL leaders of that time were racists, they COULD have known better because other people did at their time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My family arrived here after the 1960s, I can&amp;#39;t be made the pay higher taxes for the sins of the past. Alternatively, my family was opposed to segregation and marched in the Civil Rights era, why should I sacrifice to correct what we opposed then?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Americans long dead fought to establish this country and you share in those benefits even though your ancestors did not live here at that time. Also, you share in the benefits created by those segregated programs and so you must also share in the costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are all-Jewish, all-Italian, all-Mexican neighborhoods all over this country, are you saying everyone was forced to live that way and no one choose to live with like-minded people for access to similar churches, grocery stores, etc? Are you saying we should forcibly integrate those neighborhoods that exist today?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No one should be forced into particular neighborhoods, that&amp;#39;s the whole point. But to deny that African Americans were forced into certain neighborhoods is a-historical. Yes, some people may choose to stay in segregated neighborhoods for certain conveniences, but African Americans to this day face barriers to integrating white neighborhoods (they are stopped or followed by police more often, their children are more likely to be punished in school for behavior that white students are not, their children are also more likely to not be seen as &amp;quot;capable&amp;quot; for difficult classes or activities).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t black people share some responsibility for their own success? Crime rates are high in black neighborhoods, so whites are justified in resisting integration. Doesn&amp;#39;t black ghetto culture have to change before we address this disparity?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone, black, white, Hispanic, etc should share responsibility for their success. It is undeniable though that black students and homeowners have to work &amp;quot;twice as hard&amp;quot; to succeed and this does pay off, it&amp;#39;s less than the payoff for whites. As pointed out in &amp;quot;The New Jim Crow&amp;quot; African Americans are less likely to use or sell drugs than whites but they are more likely to be arrested for use or sale and once arrested, continuously re-arrested and imprisoning nonviolent offenders in low-income neighborhoods has a multi-generational effect by removing one parent from the home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

All they talk about is race. Their favorite topic is what white people can and cannot say. White men mostly.

I have these university students telling me that white people cant be the victims of racism or profiling. Yet I’ve had to hide in the bushes walking home as a kid, for being white, in the wrong place at the wrong time.


I don’t think all black people are gang bangers, never. Not then, not now. But after living that life I find it borderline insulting to have these rich privileged girls from nice neighborhoods tell me that the one time they think a store owner was bad-eyeing them means they have a monopoly on politics of race, or whatever.


They have barely any life experience with race. They stick to social circles centered around race. Yet these are the kids who are supposed to be fixing racism in our country?

* All tiers
* Pass a federal background check, eliminating the gun show loophole.

* Pass a background check
* Pass a basic hunting/firearm safety class
* Provide a receipt for an appropriately-sized gun locker, or trigger lock per registered gun.
* Tier 2 – Semi-automatic rifles
* Have a Tier 1 license for at least 1 year
* Be at least 21 years of age
* Pass an advanced firearm safety class.
* Tier 3 – Advanced and automatic weaponry
* Maintain current restrictions and definitions (National Firearms Act of 1934)
* Ban high-capacity magazines
* Require submission of fingerprints and DNA to the FBI
* Submit to a gun locker inspection to ensure it can house the weapons
* Undergo yearly refresher trainings on the use of these firearms.
* Anyone with a history of violence, domestic abuse, or violent mental illness would be restricted from receiving a license.

* Be grandfathered in with their current license, and for the 1-year requirement if they decide to apply for a Tier 2 license
* Receive a one-time “Good Gun Owner” tax credit for adhering to the additional requirements implemented by the new system
* Be allowed a tax write-off for the purchase of any equipment required to adhere to the new standards
* Be allowed to register any currently unregistered firearm without facing any penalties.
* Individual states will determine their concealed carry/open carry laws, and reciprocity will not be federally enforced. However, a concealed or open carry license in one state would satisfy all licensure requirements in all states.
* Prohibit the manufacture and sale of bump stocks, suppressors, incendiary/exploding ammunition, and (yes, this is currently legal) grenade launcher attachments.
* Create federal safety guidelines for gun manufacture and distribution, similar to federal car safety requirements, with strict penalties for the violation of these guidelines.
* Encourage gun manufacturers to implement designs that prevent interchanging parts that alter the functionality of the firearm.
* Implement a federal buyback program for anyone who wants to voluntarily give up their firearm.
* Invest in innovative technology that would make firearms harder to fire for non-owners of the gun, and create a federal, bipartisan panel to determine when technological innovations are advanced and reliable enough to be included in manufacturing safety requirements.
* As stated here, invest in a more robust mental health infrastructure. This will help to identify and treat people with mental health illnesses that make them prone to violence.
* Increase funding to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, and drastically increase funding to the US Department of Veterans Affairs Suicide Prevention efforts.

The reason for that is many of the human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia for smaller crimes, secular liberal people being punished and such, the attacks on Yemen at the expense of Yemeni citizens and not just opposition, (I believe a lot of citizen death could be avoided and dealt with without bombing the country) 

as well as the spread of Wahhabism or saladism which many other Muslims dislike but Saudi sponsors mosques.

Context: I am from Western Europe.

Sexual violence and abuse, of all kinds, is an issue which rightfully comes up in the public debate from time to time. Whether it is physically forcing someone to do something they do not want, abusing your power (as a teacher, supervisor, employer, ...) to obtain sexual favours, or psychologically manipulating someone into having sex with you, these things still happen way too often today, and it is important that we talk about how to do something about it.

There is no obvious solution. I notice that often anger of protesters (often women's rights activists) is directed at the legal system for being too soft on rapists in terms of punishment, for not trying hard enough to find incriminating evidence, sometimes also for not giving enough credit to testimonies of victims.

Whether or not anger at the legal system is justified will depend on the specific country you are in; there are definitely many countries in the world, even Europe, where the definition of rape is too narrow and punishments disproportionally mild compared to other crimes. However, it is my opinion that, in the end, the legal system will not be able to definitively address the problem of sexual violence and abuse. Here's my reasoning:

1. Any legal system in a proper democracy, to be just, requires that the accused get the benefit of the doubt. Suggesting that a testimony of a victim should be sufficient evidence to incriminate an alleged rapist, inevitably means questioning the very foundations of a free society. A society where one accusation is sufficient to put someone in jail, cannot call itself free. The fact that 99.9% of rape accusations are justified is not relevant.
2. As long as we value even a minimal form of privacy in our society, we will *never* be able to gather enough evidence to prove sexual violence/abuse, because even though you might be able to prove that two people had intercourse, it is impossible to prove that this was without consent. When people think of rape they might think of women being hauled of the street by some strangers in the middle of the night, but the vast majority of cases of sexual assault and abuse happen between people who know each other, in which case it is very hard to prove the absence of consent. Even modern ideas like 'Sexual consent apps' where you have to sign a legally binding contract consenting to having sex before initiating - besides being quite invasive and unsexy - miss the point of consent: that it is something continuous which one should be able to withdraw at any time, even in the middle of sexual activity.

It is perhaps a frustrating truth, but fighting sexual violence will have to come from changes in mentality. I am not an expert on this matter, but I am afraid the best methods we have to achieve change are the 'softer' methods. Incorporating the topic of consensual sex in school curricula. Creating awareness and alertness among night club staff. Establishing deontological rules about relationships between students and teachers (resp. employees and employers). Fixing gender imbalance in certain professions or sectors. And so on.

**EDIT:** I would like to clarify that by legal system I specifically mean the juridicial branch of government, i.e. courts and police. I do not doubt that governments have a responsibility in information campaigns around sexual consent, for example, but this falls outside of the 'hard' solutions that I wanted to question with this post.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perhaps unnecessary trigger warning: rape, sexual assault&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You both are without any memory of what civilization is like or their judgements on you. Your only perspective of yourself is your own and the nice woman who is with you. (We’re going to say she’s nice for the sake of the argument.) The only world you would know is the one where you’re accepted for what you are. In this case would you really care if someone thinks of you fully as a woman? You get to act, dress and do what you want. Your shade of gender is fully accepted. The thought of someone even hating on you for being different doesn’t exist. You never experienced it. The real problem truly arises when we turn the nice woman into a hateful woman.

I believe this push to call transexuals “real” females or males is the wrong push. It’s a demographic wide push into delusion rather than a push towards acceptance of what makes you different in the first place. My argument is this: If you are different then why does it matter? If you are trans and feel this bad about this then I believe others made you feel like it matters and you’re responding to that. Being trans is unique. You are your own thing and only a few others get to be like you. You are your own shade of female or male. What matters is that others are accepting you being different rather than hating you for it. The major push for trans rights shouldn’t be the push to be SEEN like everyone else rather it should be so that you’re TREATED like how you want to be treated.

What’s is really so wrong with being different?

Some background here: I’ve dealt with mental illness for most of my life. I have had lots of problems with people and lots problems in certain areas in my life. Lots of bullying. I pushed myself a lot to try to be something I’m not. And the more I pushed myself towards being someone I could never hope to be, the more I would hate myself for not being able to reach the ideal in my mind. I wanted to desperately be something I am not because others told me I could in an attempt to make me feel better. I was delusional for awhile and it burnt me out. I almost got close to suicide. What helped me recover was things like meditation and Buddhism. The acceptance of what is instead of what I want.

I’m open for a more nuanced discussion about this. I’d like to know about more perspectives. I know that not every trans person feels this way but it seems like a large swath of them do and there’s a thread I saw earlier of people arguing that you need to see every trans as a “real” woman or man. This doesn’t feel like a real push towards acceptance to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Well that was quick. I think I need to rethink this. There is a large amount of things I do not understand about gender. My arguments need to be refined and I need to educate myself. 

Thanks for the comments. I'm going to close this off now.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of this hypothetical scenario: You are a MtF and you are stranded on an island with another person, a biological woman. You both are without any memory of what civilization is like or their judgements on you. Your only perspective of yourself is your own and the nice woman who is with you. (We’re going to say she’s nice for the sake of the argument.) The only world you would know is the one where you’re accepted for what you are. In this case would you really care if someone thinks of you fully as a woman? You get to act, dress and do what you want. Your shade of gender is fully accepted. The thought of someone even hating on you for being different doesn’t exist. You never experienced it. The real problem truly arises when we turn the nice woman into a hateful woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe this push to call transexuals “real” females or males is the wrong push. It’s a demographic wide push into delusion rather than a push towards acceptance of what makes you different in the first place. My argument is this: If you are different then why does it matter? If you are trans and feel this bad about this then I believe others made you feel like it matters and you’re responding to that. Being trans is unique. You are your own thing and only a few others get to be like you. You are your own shade of female or male. What matters is that others are accepting you being different rather than hating you for it. The major push for trans rights shouldn’t be the push to be SEEN like everyone else rather it should be so that you’re TREATED like how you want to be treated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s is really so wrong with being different?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some background here: I’ve dealt with mental illness for most of my life. I have had lots of problems with people and lots problems in certain areas in my life. Lots of bullying. I pushed myself a lot to try to be something I’m not. And the more I pushed myself towards being someone I could never hope to be, the more I would hate myself for not being able to reach the ideal in my mind. I wanted to desperately be something I am not because others told me I could in an attempt to make me feel better. I was delusional for awhile and it burnt me out. I almost got close to suicide. What helped me recover was things like meditation and Buddhism. The acceptance of what is instead of what I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m open for a more nuanced discussion about this. I’d like to know about more perspectives. I know that not every trans person feels this way but it seems like a large swath of them do and there’s a thread I saw earlier of people arguing that you need to see every trans as a “real” woman or man. This doesn’t feel like a real push towards acceptance to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

I've received strong critics for this kind of thoughts but when I ask why no one knows what to answer.

For me thinking a human life is more valuable than any other animal life (or mammal life to make it simpler) is just as selfish as thinking you are more valuable than other humans.

I understand selfishness is necessary but in case of emergency we have rules to prevent selfish actions like women and kids being saved first, right?

But if you look into the details of these numbers, you’ll see that they’re often not showing the whole picture. Note: I am too lazy to put in citations, but a quick google search will verify my stats if you have any doubts.

STDs:

In the case of STDs, the incidence is something that’s rarely talked about because it doesn’t make good pamphlet material. Chlamydia (aka “the clap”) is the most common STD in the states, but only about 0.5% of people have it. And that 0.5% isn’t anywhere close to evenly distributed in the population. It is a lot more common among those with less education, low income, drug users, and ethnic minorities, particularly blacks. Half a percent is already pretty low, but the odds that a non-drug-using college educated middle class person has it are miniscule. The same is true for other STDs that have an even lower overall incidence. Also – side note – a lot of the more common bacterial STDs can be cured pretty easily (Chlamydia, Gonorrhea) and more recently you can get get vaccinated against some of the viral ones (cancer causing strains of HPV, Hepatitis).
HIV is still one of the scariest ones – sure it won’t kill you like it used to, but who wants to live with something like that hanging over your head. Still, the chances of contracting HIV from heterosexual vaginal sex are less than 1 in 1500 (and it’s even lower for men due to the biomechanics involved). And, again, if you are using common sense and not having unprotected sex with male bisexuals who are also IV-drug-users, the odds fall even more.

Pregnancy

So, how about pregnancy? Is pulling out only for the foolish, irresponsible risk-taker? Well… let’s look at that failure rate for pulling out. 25% sounds pretty high, until you look at the details of the study where that number comes from. First, that 25% number is based on a full year of people having unprotected sex using only that method. Also – and more importantly – researchers found out the pull out method almost always failed because of user error. Granted there is some scientific disagreement, but a couple studies have shown that, it’s nearly impossible to get pregnant from pre-cum because it contains little to no living sperm. So, in other words, this inflated stat comes almost entirely from some idiots with no self-control finding their way into a sex study and, over the course of a year, having who knows how many accidental “sorry the phone ringing distracted me” moments. If done correctly – fairly easy for most guys – the pull out method is very reliable. For the extremely risk averse, it could also be combined with avoiding high risk times of the month to make the chances of getting pregnant pretty much nil.
On a related note, consider another number – 25%. That is the approximate average chance an adult female has of getting pregnant in a given month. Yep. An entire month of unprotected sex to completion – including while she is ovulating – and there’s still a 75% chance of no pregnancy. Of course no one is suggesting it’s a good idea to just roll the dice and forget about using any method at all – 25% is way too high a number – but to suggest that pulling out is equally risky is ridiculous.

My view

Unprotected sex carries with it a risk. That much is obvious. But, unless you’re frequently engaging in high risk behaviors with high risk people, that risk is entirely blown out of proportion and has become more paranoid dogma than anything based on the actual numbers. The chances of contracting an STD are very low, and the odds of contracting one that will be more than a minor temporary inconvenience are tiny. The same is true for pregnancy. The odds of getting pregnant from pre-ejaculate alone are likely down there with the odds of a condom breaking leading to pregnancy – maybe it could happen, but I don’t think it’s something that should be keeping you up nights. Sometimes I wonder if there aren’t other motivations for pushing the idea that unprotected sex is so incredibly dangerous. Purely looking at the numbers, the paranoia seems unfounded.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you google stuff about STDs and accidental pregnancy the first things that pop up sound pretty scary. “You have a high chance of getting an STD if your partner is infected.” “The pull out method fails 25% of the time.” Teachers and counselors trot out all kinds of frightening numbers and basically make it sound like anyone not using a condom is playing Russian roulette with pregnancy and disease.

Any man who chimes in (with an anti abortion opinion) is told their opinion is invalid and doesn’t matter because it’s not their body. But if they agree with abortion they’re held up on a pedestal and glorified. So really your thoughts don’t matter, unless you agree.

The whole concept makes no sense. Why can’t men be knowledgeable on a subject just because it doesn’t personally revolve around them? We have infinite resources to learn about anything. There are male gynecologist, male obstetrician etc (men generally specializing in women’s health) . Then there are women who specialize in many men’s health areas. Most women have opinions on male circumcision, vasectomies, and paper abortions but we don’t see “no penis, no opinion”.

Not to mention the same amount of men as women support abortion, so why aren’t we letting them speak? Telling someone they can not voice their views about a specific topic and they don’t matter just because of their gender is unjust and helps no one.

I’m sure you’ve heard “no uterus, no opinion” often lately due to the recent dramatic laws being passed. Any man who chimes in (with an anti abortion opinion) is told their opinion is invalid and doesn’t matter because it’s not their body. But if they agree with abortion they’re held up on a pedestal and glorified. So really your thoughts don’t matter, unless you agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole concept makes no sense. Why can’t men be knowledgeable on a subject just because it doesn’t personally revolve around them? We have infinite resources to learn about anything. There are male gynecologist, male obstetrician etc (men generally specializing in women’s health) . Then there are women who specialize in many men’s health areas. Most women have opinions on male circumcision, vasectomies, and paper abortions but we don’t see “no penis, no opinion”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention the same amount of men as women support abortion, so why aren’t we letting them speak? Telling someone they can not voice their views about a specific topic and they don’t matter just because of their gender is unjust and helps no one. It only makes you seem ignorant and unwilling to hear other sides of a debate&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I am female. So please stop asking me how I’d feel if someone made me get a vasectomy or made laws about my dick. This isn’t about laws being made, taking away reproductive rights/ freedom, or who gets to decide if the woman has an abortion. It’s about men being allowed to have an opinion on abortion and voice it&lt;/p&gt;

I spent some time researching the topic and I have come to the conclusion that people have no business keeping cockatoos as pets. I believe this for the following reasons:

1. **Cockatoos are not domesticated.** They have not been bred/adapted by the same process used on cats and dogs, to thrive in captivity. They are the exact same animal you find in the wild, and are [not adapted to living their lives in cages](https://www.thedodo.com/its-time-to-admit-birds-shouldnt-be-caged-as-pets-1540187340.html) like a dog or cat is adapted to living in close proximity with people.

2. **Cockatoos have the [mental capacity of a four-year-old child.](https://www.theguardian.com/science/grrlscientist/2013/sep/04/cockatoos-are-smarter-than-human-babies)** When you buy a cockatoo, you are actually adopting the equivalent of a toddler into your household. Many people who buy these beautiful birds do not know this.

3. **Cockatoos require the same amount of [attention and mental stimulation as a toddler.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbHH2_6Monw)** They need to be held and played with for many hours a day to thrive, just like a human child. This can be a daunting task, especially for owners who then go on to have their own children. The video linked is an ideal interaction between a pet cockatoo and owner, and note that the cockatoo you see was rescued from an abusive situation.

4. **Cockatoos that do not receive proper mental stimulation develop [mental issues.](https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/blogs/the-heartbreaking-world-of-captive-exotic-birds)** They routinely suffer from separation anxiety, neurosis, and psychosis and often resort to self-mutilation.

5. **[Cockatoos are extremely loud.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXxO-3Z2yMI)** This is a feature, not a bug, of the species. [They do not have an off button.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f8xnaDIAow) Their screams are piercing, mentally rattling, almost supersonically irritating. Attempts to train them to be quiet are dubious at best, and cause the birds mental anguish at worst (their volume is one of the most common reasons they are surrendered) due to abusive training practices (people screaming and throwing things at the bird).

6. **[Cockatoo bites can be dangerous.](https://tongueinbeak.wordpress.com/2013/09/16/the-anatomy-of-the-parrot-bite/)** Their beaks are tools to crack nuts, and weapons to use against enemies. They undergo hormonal changes twice a year, during breeding season, and that can result in surprise bites, especially if you unintentionally sexually excite and then frustrate your bird (petting anywhere other then the head of your bird [is a precurser to a sexual act](https://bird-paradise.biz/lets-talk-about-the-birds-the-bees-with-birds/) for many species of bird, including cockatoos).

7. **Cockatoos live for 50-70 years.** [They are a long-term commitment,](https://pets.thenest.com/life-span-cockatoos-6199.html) your entire lifetime, and often need to be included in an owner's will. Because they are so demanding, they can expect to be passed from home to home, until ending up in a sanctuary or in a forever home (until it isn't, or the owner dies and the bird is rehomed again). This means that a cockatoo is likely to, eventually, end up in a neglectful or abusive home, simply due to the sheer longevity of their lives. I find this a particularly horrifying thought. 

8. **[A large number of rescue birds are cockatoos](http://mtrushmorebirds.com/cockatoos-think-carefully-before-buying/)** (along with african greys and macaws). This is because of the sheer amount of work, effort, and expense that cockatoos require to remain happy and healthy. As a species that develops strong bonds with people, being passed from owner to owner is traumatic, and adds to the possibility of developing mental issues.


In conclusion, I don't feel the pleasure people derive from keeping these birds offsets the neglect and abuse these birds suffer --- either intentionally or unintentionally --- at the hands of people. **I feel that Cockatoos should not be pets, because I don't believe that the majority of these birds live consistently good lives with people, due to the reasons above.** 


Please note, I have no issue with cockatiels, conures, parakeets, finches, lovebirds, and other small birds being kept as pets, because they are not as mentally developed and do not tend to suffer in captivity like cockatoos do.

Hey guys! This opinion formed after doing extensive research on the 2020 democratic candidates, and finding that several (such as Mayor Pete) look to abolish the electoral college. With this I thought to myself, ""why should we have an electoral college anyways?"" and thus, this opinion was formed. Let's dive right in!

&amp;#x200B;

Note: please read all of my examples and all of the links I site as ""proof"". I do not want to have to type out all of that every time somebody responds to this (sorry, im really lazy :P)

anyways, happy reading!

# The argument for the electoral college

In my research, I have heard a few primary arguments in favor of the electoral college.

&amp;#x200B;

1. The electoral college was formed by the founding fathers to prevent uneducated or uninformed voters from voting somebody that would be negative for our country. This still applies.
2. The Electoral College ensures that all states are equally involved in the selection of the President.
3. The electoral college simplifies the voting process and avoids mistakes (and creates certainty in elections)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not going to explain the reasoning behind those views any further. This is just as a reference. [You can start here](https://www.procon.org/headline.php?headlineID=005330) if you'd like to learn more specifics.

&amp;#x200B;

# My refutations for the pro-electoral college argument

I will now attempt to refute the 3 main arguments I've heard in favor of the electoral college (in order of previous appearance). These refutations inherently strengthen my case, and I will reference them in my own points.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Each argument has issues, but the general problem is that the electoral college gives certain people less of an opinion (essentially). I will now go into each of the 3 arguments:
   1. The original point of the electoral college is outdated by definition. As stated earlier, the original purpose of the electoral college was to prevent uneducated or uninformed voters from making poor decisions. There are several issues with this. First and foremost, the large majority of Americans are considered ""educated"". [According to the US Census](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2018/07/educational-attainment.html), over 90% of Americans have achieved a high school degree (which is already more educated then the large majority of voters in 18th century America), and over [1/3 of Americans](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/cb17-51.html) have a college degree and higher. By this, it is obvious that *education* isn't an issue for American's anymore. But what about being uninformed? [While more and more people are beginning to vote](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/reports/2018/07/11/453319/increasing-voter-participation-america/), there is a constant issue with how informed a voter is. The primary argument here is flawed, however; the electoral college suggests essentially taking away the voter's responsibility to be informed by taking away the decision for them. By removing the electoral college, it would become more important for Americans to become informed. As a secondary point, it makes no sense to base a system off of something that will *always* happen. Instead of stifling the voices of millions of Americans, we should work on better ways to inform them.
   2. The main problem with this argument is this: ***States don't elect officials. People do.*** So while it is true, a smaller state would have a bigger voice due to the electoral college, this doesn't mean that the residents in that state have an equal voice. In fact, it's quite the opposite. Take California, for example. [Over 50% of the residents of California](https://ucanr.edu/sites/UC_CCP/files/125967.pdf) live in 4 individual counties, with [over 94% living in highly urbanized areas](https://ucanr.edu/sites/UC_CCP/files/125967.pdf) (big cities). This means that only 6% of the population (around 1.8 million people) live in rural areas. Because of the electoral college system, the *general consensus* of what people want to happen in government would be heard, but the millions of people's voices would not. In other words, while urban voters would get their general wishes (which are often similar), rural voter's issues would be drowned out. This doesn't even begin to touch on the issues with [California's political voter diversity](https://www.ppic.org/publication/californias-political-geography/), which is very low (meaning most voters are liberal). The conservative voters become virtually unheard, because no matter what California will go democratic and thus those electoral college votes will always go to the Democratic candidate. That is hardly fair for the millions of people living in California whose opinions are now rendered essentially invalid. Tying this back to the original point, while the *states* issues may be fulfilled, many individuals issues will not be. And the president shouldn't be elected based on general needs. Every individual person should get an equal say in it. Under the current system, some peoples votes are worth a lot less than others. For example, [Wyoming's voters have 3.6 times more influence then their Californian counterparts](https://theconversation.com/whose-votes-count-the-least-in-the-electoral-college-74280) (read the article I won't go into more detail). This essentially means that an individual in California's opinion is worth *less* just because of the electoral college system. That is inherently **unfair**.
   3. This is a very weak argument. The electoral college doesn't really [simplify voting processes](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/03/why-every-argument-for-preserving-the-electoral-college-is-wrong-warren-cnn.html); it just drags them out. If we were to simply count up every vote in America and the candidate with the most votes wins, it would save a lot of time. There would be less individual counting and a lot less time wasted watching the ""state"" results coming in. It would be person by person. We wouldn't have to wait for each individual state to tally their votes. Regardless of this, it is still a weak argument in comparison to the [harm it creates](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/opinion/the-electoral-college.html). When weighing this debate on almost any mechanism, almost *any* argument against the electoral college outweighs this argument *for* it.

&amp;#x200B;

Any additional subpoint I'd like to add (and refute)

&amp;#x200B;

One common argument in favor of the EC is: ""the President will always be a democrat/liberal picked by New York and California, because they have more people""

in response to that: 4.4 million Californians voted for Trump. Almost 3 million New Yorkers voted for Trump. Compare that to a state, say,  Arizona, which only had 1.3M vote for Trump. Or Mississippi which only had 700 thousand vote for Trump. Another 200,000 votes and California would have had more Trump voters than Texas. California was almost the state with the most votes for Trump by those numbers.

This shows that there are many votes going unheard in these states.

(credit to  u/[keanwood](https://www.reddit.com/user/keanwood) for pointing this out, adding it to my personal reasons for why it should be abolished)

# Why the electoral college needs to go

Here are my reasons the electoral college needs to go.

1. **The electoral college ignores the will of the people.**
2. The electoral college gives too much power to swing states.
3. **The electoral college squanders the different opinions of people in the same state by forcing their** ***entire*** **state to vote** ***one*** **way.**

\#1 and #3 are my biggest points. Prove to me that the electoral college doesn't ignore the will of the people, and prove to me that the electoral college doesn't render the opinions of many people in a state invalid, and I will begin to CMV.

# Explanation of my views

1. My first point is pretty simple. 538 people decide the fate of over 300 million Americans. Additionally, the millions of people with differing opinions in each state are rendered invalid by the electoral college. Take the 2016 election, for example. The majority of Americans wanted Hillary Clinton, yet Trump won. or in 2000 with George Bush. Both ways, the will of the majority of Americans was ignored in favor of the will of 538 people.
2. The electoral college makes the president dependent on winning a handful of swing states. Because of this, many presidents [visit any states besides these swing states](https://www.procon.org/headline.php?headlineID=005330#19). This inherently gives too much power to these swing states, which would defeat the purpose of the electoral college (giving more equal power to every state). A simplified explanation would be that it is known that California will almost always vote in favor of a democrat (in the electoral college), so there is little power in making a decision there. States that swing in which party they vote for, such as Florida, thus become much more powerful.
3. I explain this much better in my refutations of the arguments in favor of the electoral college, so I won't repeat myself. To sum it up, though, people with differing opinions in states are left invalid because the state will always ""swing"" a certain way in the electoral college. For example is California, which will almost always vote democratic majority and thus vote democratically in the electoral college, making the opinions of conservatives in California basically worthless.

Note: The reason i'm not going in to more detail in my explanation of my views is because a large majority of the studies/proof/examples of what I'm arguing I already included in my refutations of the argument in favor of the electoral college, and I am too lazy to retype it out again. 

&amp;#x200B;

# How to CMV

Prove to me that the electoral college doesn't ignore the will of the people, and prove to me that the electoral college fairly accounts for *everybody's* *individual opinion equally*, and I will *start* to CMV.

***IMPORTANT:***

To 100% CMV without question, please prove that the electoral college system is in some way **superior** to a popular vote wins system, or how a electoral college system is better in general.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

I disagree with this movement and view it as potentially very dangerous.

While I haven't looked extensively into scientific reporting on the subject, I think there very clearly can be a link between the two when thinking about it with common sense:

If you tell an impressionable child or teenager that they should always be happy with their body regardless of what people say, this will lead to them believing they should not focus on their physical health as much as they should.

This is a dangerous mindset, as normalizing obesity for the sake of positive mental health can lead to a drastic degradation in one's physical health.

This is not a pro-fat-shaming view, as I don't think anyone should be shamed for their body, but promoting that everyone should always be accepting of their weight in any case is dangerous.

*Disclaimer: I have no experience in debate.

A little bit of background first. Since becoming a poster on r/CMV, I remembered that my high school had a debate club. So, let's go on YouTube and enjoy high quality debates! Then, I searched 2018 debate championships. I couldn't believe my ears. They were speaking so fast at 300 words per minute or something, I couldn't understand anything.

Why were they doing this? It turns out that it's a technique called spreading. Spreading is the act of speaking extremely fast during a competitive debating event, with the hope that one's opponent will be penalised for failing to respond to all arguments raised. So if I use my allocated time to raise 10 points, and you only respond to 8, the judge will automatically rule in favour of me for the two remaining points.

I understand that judges are mostly ex-debators and are trained to listen to and understand these debators. However, outside the circuit of debators and judges, most outsiders do not understand a single point made in the debate.

I am sure that there are benefits to outsiders being able to understand the points being made in the debate. I will not go into detail on these benefits. It will certainly help debate as a spectator sport - I am a case in point. Another benefit, of course, is to appreciate other perspectives. Imagine if /r/CMV was only speech and spoken at 300 words per minute.

As these debators are just playing within the rules of the competition, maybe it is the competition itself that should be changed.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;An example: &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FPsEwWT6K0""&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FPsEwWT6K0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It pays great tribute to the previous movies in the franchise and manages to incorporate almost every major character which has appeared in the franchise. It is highly entertaining, well choreographed, and visually stunning. However, just like every other movie revolving around the concept of time travel, it is full of plot holes. In this post, I am not arguing that Endgame is a bad movie (it is lots of fun!); I am only arguing that the time travel concept was extremely flawed.

1. **Did the Hulk casually discover a way to keep people eternally young?** At the very beginning of their time travel experiments, the Hulk accidentally made time ""go through"" Antman, which first transformed him into a baby, then turned him into an old man, until finally restoring him back to his current age. Does this mean that now people can use the machine to turn themselves young any time they want to?
2. **Why didn't the Avengers start by going back to the past and getting more Pim particles?** Once Captain America and Iron Man fail their mission to secure the Tesseract, they decide to travel back to 1970 and get more Pim particles which they can use for extra time travel. This begs the question, why didn't they start their mission by doing exactly that? The Avengers could have easily gone back in time and collected as many Pim particles as they want before engaging on their main mission.
3. **How does time travel in Avengers: Endgame work exactly?** From the little explanation the movie offers, we can conclude that when you travel through time, you split the timeline of your destination into two timelines; the first is the ""original"" timeline, and the second is the new timeline you create via your arrival. This prevents the [**Grandfather paradox**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_paradox) but raises a lot of other questions. For example, once you have created additional timelines, how do you travel back to them? Do you keep some sort of an IP for each timeline you have visited? Also, when the Avengers go back in time to return the infinity stones, don't they just create new branching ""good"" timelines instead of ""fixing"" the bad timelines?
4. **If for some reason time travel does not always split timelines, why don't Avengers from different timelines unite and destroy their enemies in each of these timelines?** The young Gamora from 2012 already ended up helping the current day Avengers in their battle with Thanos, but wouldn't things have been easier if there were a few more Captain Marvels with them?
5. **What is the deal with Nebula bringing the entire army of Thanos to a future timeline with just a single Pim particle?** Sure, Thanos' ship was shrunk and then enlarged by Nebula upon her arrival, but why didn't the Avengers use the same approach to conserve their Pim particles? Also, if they can travel to the future (and supposedly go back), why don't they go there, get some advanced weaponry and technology, and use them for battles and research?
6. **If we have potentially infinitely many alternate timelines, how much should we care about the heroes which have died in some of them?** Sure, Tony Stark and Black Widow from the main timeline are gone forever, but there are potentially infinitely many living copies of them. Any character can travel through time and meet their deceased friends whenever they want. Heroes from other timelines can travel to the current timeline and stay (like Gamora). We can't help but feel that this somehow reduces the emotional impact of Tony Stark's and Black Widow's deaths.
7. **Why is old Captain America sitting on the bench next to the lake at the end of the movie?** The movie suggests that when Captain America traveled back to the past, he decided to stay there and grow old with Peggy Carter. At the end, he somehow ends up on the bench next to the lake as an old man in the same timeline he left. However, this is contradictory to the time travel mechanics which were introduced earlier in the movie.

I hope you manage to change my views at least on a few of the points I have raised above.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is undeniable that Avengers: Endgame is the most ambitious MCU movie so far. It pays great tribute to the previous movies in the franchise and manages to incorporate almost every major character which has appeared in the franchise. It is highly entertaining, well choreographed, and visually stunning. However, just like every other movie revolving around the concept of time travel, it is full of plot holes. In this post, I am not arguing that Endgame is a bad movie (it is lots of fun!); I am only arguing that the time travel concept was extremely flawed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did the Hulk casually discover a way to keep people eternally young?&lt;/strong&gt; At the very beginning of their time travel experiments, the Hulk accidentally made time &amp;quot;go through&amp;quot; Antman, which first transformed him into a baby, then turned him into an old man, until finally restoring him back to his current age. Does this mean that now people can use the machine to turn themselves young any time they want to?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why didn&amp;#39;t the Avengers start by going back to the past and getting more Pim particles?&lt;/strong&gt; Once Captain America and Iron Man fail their mission to secure the Tesseract, they decide to travel back to 1970 and get more Pim particles which they can use for extra time travel. This begs the question, why didn&amp;#39;t they start their mission by doing exactly that? The Avengers could have easily gone back in time and collected as many Pim particles as they want before engaging on their main mission.&lt;/li&gt;

Right now, we have more than enough oil, which is why prices are low, but it's kind of like having more food in the pantry than you can eat in a single evening. It looks like a lot, you might even be tempted to throw a party, but when you have no reliable way to restock the pantry, you should treat it like a precious resource.

Even assuming we'll beat climate change--[and there's zero evidence that we will](https://skepticalscience.com/ipcc-global-warming-pause.htm)\--there are no renewable energy resources which can sustain the large, expensive, oil-intensive industries that provide most of us food and water. And forget about electricity, the new dark age we are entering might be literal.

A 1-to-1 replacement of fossil fuels and renewable energy is impossible, [as Germany has found out](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2019/01/01/can-wind-and-solar-replace-fossil-fuels/). A lot of people point to the promise of [totally unproven future technologies](https://medium.com/wedonthavetime/progress-on-carbon-co2-capture-1ff84b1164c4), but that's kind of like trying to pay your landlord by showing him all your job applications--our planet does not care how hard we try. And it's irresponsible to expect scientists to solve all your problems for you, especially when there are zero scientists telling us to bet the fate of humanity on their research.

Our only option is a massive reduction in the quality of our lifestyles.

Our lifestyles are **not sustainable**, which, by definition, means that at some point in the future they are mathematically required to stop. When they stop, we're talking about a reduction to pre-industrial levels, the last time human civilization had no oil, in which a large majority of humans engaged in sustenance farming. The problem right now is that we've forgotten entirely how to farm, and many people faced with transition from a relatively luxurious high-tech lifestyle to sustenance farming would gladly choose suicide. This is not to say it will be easy even for those eager to return to the earth, either. Farming is hard, and [becoming a competent organic gardener takes five to ten years](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2010-08-26/care-and-feeding-time-machines/). And even those with the time, and the foresight, and the desire to make this transition may have no access to land to actually grow the food. Land is ridiculously expensive, and the assumption of easy access to fossil fuels is baked into the price of land. 

And you might think we have a full 48 years to adapt (2067), but the reality is that, at some point, oil will be a strategic asset that only the military (which is impotent without it) and the ultra-rich have access to, at any price. Even before then, it will be priced beyond affordability for most Americans, who will suddenly have no way to get to work and nobody to work for, hence the broad range of 20-40 years. This places the end of civilization, potentially, within my lifetime, how about you?

Is there reason to be optimistic? Absolutely. Millions if not billions of humans will be skilled and lucky enough to adapt and survive, but they won't be the members of a global civilization and they won't be members of any civilization we would recognize. Importantly, they won't have our values. They may not think that having access to luxuries like entertainment and transportation and global communication are a good thing, since they will be living in the wreckage of world created from those desires.

The same goes for heavy drinkers who have been offered psychological and physical help. If they continue and end up with a condition like cirrhosis, that's their fault.

I'm not saying that because of this, they shouldn't be allowed treatment, I just think they should have to pay for it. This way, people who've dramatically influenced their conditions don't get all their treatment for free.

Although I know drinking and smoking are serious and may be some kind of coping mechanism, if there was a situation where they had been offered enough help to get off their addictions and sort out anything they need to, but they continued to drink or smoke, they should need to pay for healthcare, and others should possibly be prioritised over them depending on the situation.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, there is something called the NHS - the national health service, which provides mostly free healthcare*.

Those tribes usually pictured live in precarious villages in arid, desert land, I can’t imagine they also have plenty of food sources, due to them living so far away from water sources. Shouldn’t they move out to survive? Are they doomed to thirst for water? Is it really the responsibility of other countries to deal with that?

I’d love to be educated and my view changed on why these tribes don’t assemble into migrations to better lands, whether it relates to their cultural attachment to their lands or whether it is a more fickle political discourse, maybe relating to industrial expansion, but as far as I understood, the industrial advancements on Africa is very low, and concentrated on specific regions, while Africa itself is a colossal landmass.

Please be gentle, I didn’t make this thread out of racist resentment, but merely curiosity. Due to the controversial nature of the matter, I’ve made a throwaway account but this is in no way intended for trolling or soapboxing.

Most of the proposals I&amp;#39;ve seen involve the complex buildng of water extracting infrastructure directly on the land they live in, which seems to me more complex than building a new village closer to water?&lt;/p&gt;

On the very rare occasions that diversity campaigners address the ""over"" representation of various ethnic minorities (e.g. Chinese, Japanese, Indians, Jews, etc) in high-income groups, they contend that their over-representation is 100% caused by the advantageous characteristics of those groups (e.g. the Asian (or Asian migrant) emphasis on education), even though these groups also suffer from the impact of contemporary and historical racism. In short: when Whites do better than other ethnicities it is always and entirely because of White racism, and when Whites do worse than other ethnic group it is always and entirely because of the superior characteristics of those other ethnic groups.

In considering the above narrative, my view is that:

1. Socio-economomic outcome is _partly_ directly determined by individual characteristics (e.g. skills, knowledge, personality traits, analytical skills, etc, etc), which I shall refer to as ""outcome-relevant characteristics"". Socio-economic outcome is also directly shaped by contemproary racist bias, nepotism, chance, etc. Diversity campaigners want a world where outcome is determined by outcome-relevant characteristics, not unfair biases and lack of connections (an aim I would 100% agree with).

2. It is true that all ethnic minorities suffer from the pervasive racist bias of the White majority.

3. Nevertheless, the socio-economic outcome of _some_ minority ethnity groups in White-dominated societies far exceed the socio-economic outcomes of Whites in those societies. Such ""over"" achieving groups include Chinese, Japanese, Indians and Jews (I appreciate that Jews are today usually included within the shifting definition of ""White"", but the salient point here is that they suffer discrimination). Often these groups arrived in their host countries in poverty, but rapidly overcame prejudice to decisively and permanently exceed the average wealth of the majority ethnic group (note that, these particular groups also exceed the outcomes of the majorities in non-white-majority countries in which they are a minority presence).

4. The only plausible explanation of these groups' above-average socio-economic outcomes is that individuals within these particular ethnic group are more likely than the average White person to possess some particularly advatangeous outcome-relevant characteristic, and that these characteristics have, on average, outweighed the burden of the discrimination. If racial bias were eliminated, over-represented ethnic minorities would be even further over-represented.

5. This demonstrates that the impact of racist bias on socio-economic outcome, while very real, is greatly exaggerated by standard diversity/racial justice argumentation. Racist bias has not stopped various minorities from consistently and dramatically ""out-performing"" Whites all over the world.

6. If we accept that the distribution of outcome-relevant characteristics differs significantly between Whites and some discriminated-against ethnic groups, it is not plausible to contend that outcome-relevant characteristics are 100% identical amongst Blacks, Whites, Native Americans, Maori, Australian Aborigines and all other under-represented ethnic minorities. The only plausible explanation of under-represented groups' socio-economic outcomes is that individuals within some ethnic groups are less likely than the average White person to possess some particularly advatangeous outcome-relevant characteristic and that this has, on average, exacerbated the burden of the discrimination. Such a claim would be considered unambiguously racist by most (all?) racial justice and diversity campaign groups.

7. Some individual academics and commentators risk being tarnished as racists by acknowledging that the frequency of outcome-relevant is not absolutely uniform amongt all ethnic groups, but assert that any less frequency advantageous characteristics among any non-White groups is caused entirely by historical White racism. It is certainly true that the legacy of generations of slavery, relatively poor environments, and the impact of racism through the lifecycle, has hugely impacted the distribution of outcome-relevant characteristics amongst different ethnic groups. However, once again, the ""over""-achievement of Chinese, Japanese, Indians and Jews shows that White racism is not the only historical factor which has affected the distribution of outcome-relevant characteristics among ethnic groups. It is impossible to know how much of the difference in the distribution of characteristics is due to historical White racism, and how much is due to other factors, and speculative in the extreme to assume that 100% of the decreased frequency of outcome-relevant characteristics in some non-White ethnic groups is due entirely to White racism, while the increased frequency of advantageous characteristics in some non-White ethnicities is due to entirely to other historical factors.

8. There was a world before Whites joined the African slave trade and before European colonialism. This world has also left its imprint on today's world. Judging from the achievements of so many ethnic groups in spite of pervasive White racism, I would posit that this older world, in which the Chinese, Japanese and Indians constituted the world's most densely-populated, productive and economically and politically ""developed"" societies for millennia before European dominance, has had a stronger influence on differing ethnic characteristics than the world of European dominance. It is highly implausible to assume that the conditions of this older, more long-lived world has left no imprint whatsoever on the distribution of characteristics among today's under-represented groups.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standard diversity campaigning/racial justice theorising is based on the assumption that 100% of the under-representation of any ethnic minority is caused by contemporary and historical racism.

It is certainly true that the legacy of generations of slavery, relatively poor environments, and the impact of racism through the lifecycle, has hugely impacted the distribution of outcome-relevant characteristics amongst different ethnic groups. However, once again, the &amp;quot;over&amp;quot;-achievement of Chinese, Japanese, Indians and Jews shows that White racism is not the only historical factor which has affected the distribution of outcome-relevant characteristics among ethnic groups. It is impossible to know how much of the difference in the distribution of characteristics is due to historical White racism, and how much is due to other factors, and speculative in the extreme to assume that 100% of the decreased frequency of outcome-relevant characteristics in some non-White ethnic groups is due entirely to White racism, while the increased frequency of advantageous characteristics in some non-White ethnicities is due to entirely to other historical factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a world before Whites joined the African slave trade and before European colonialism. This world has also left its imprint on today&amp;#39;s world. Judging from the achievements of so many ethnic groups in spite of pervasive White racism, I would posit that this older world, in which the Chinese, Japanese and Indians constituted the world&amp;#39;s most densely-populated, productive and economically and politically &amp;quot;developed&amp;quot; societies for millennia before European dominance, has had a stronger influence on differing ethnic characteristics than the world of European dominance. It is highly implausible to assume that the conditions of this older, more long-lived world has left no imprint whatsoever on the distribution of characteristics among today&amp;#39;s under-represented groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Some people say he shouldn't be charged because what he did is journalism, and it we charge him than we'd have to similarly charge The New York Times or any of a number of other outlets that also report on classified information. I think the charges are legitimate, and do not infringe on first amendment protections or chill journalistic freedom. I have a few reasons:

**1:** Julian Assange is not an American citizen or resident. He isn't protected by the Bill of Rights.

**2:**  Whistleblower protections should be extended for people who release information that clearly shows illegal activity by the government. However, those protections should not extend beyond that information. They should not provide protection for the negative consequences of other information released simultaneously. One good act does not immunize someone from the consequences of another bad act. In the case of Assange, he chose to release a HUGE amount of information. A tiny fraction of that information exposed wrongdoing by the US government. Releasing that tiny fraction of information was righteous. Releasing the rest was not justified.

**3:** Some people have criticized the decision to indict Assange because other news outlets later distributed excerpts from the Manning leaks. Are they also guilty of espionage? Assange's initial distribution is qualitatively different than other outlets later releasing parts of the same information because Wikileaks was the first to distribute it. Classified information is *de facto* no longer classified once it has been publicly distributed. The Wall Street Journal reporting on information from the Manning leaks does not cause any further harm, since the information is already available.

**4:** Assange apparently did not take any action to try to limit the negative consequences of releasing the Manning leaks. It is a common journalistic practice to withhold personal information in order to avoid harming people who may be tangentially involved in a story but not guilty of any wrongdoing. While this is not legally required, it shows a good faith effort to minimize harm. Assange did nothing of the sort. Personal information that could have easily been redacted without affecting the positive impact of the leak was left untouched, despite it raising obvious dangers for those involved (such as confidential informants). While this lack of concern itself is not illegal, it weakens the claim that we need to take the bad with the good. In actuality, Assange just chose not to distinguish between the two.

Some people say he shouldn&amp;#39;t be charged because what he did is journalism, and it we charge him than we&amp;#39;d have to similarly charge The New York Times or any of a number of other outlets that also report on classified information. I think the charges are legitimate, and do not infringe on first amendment protections or chill journalistic freedom. I have a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:&lt;/strong&gt; Julian Assange is not an American citizen or resident. He isn&amp;#39;t protected by the Bill of Rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2:&lt;/strong&gt;  Whistleblower protections should be extended for people who release information that clearly shows illegal activity by the government. However, those protections should not extend beyond that information. They should not provide protection for the negative consequences of other information released simultaneously. One good act does not immunize someone from the consequences of another bad act. In the case of Assange, he chose to release a HUGE amount of information. A tiny fraction of that information exposed wrongdoing by the US government. Releasing that tiny fraction of information was righteous. Releasing the rest was not justified.&lt;/p&gt;

This quote has a point. While there are some people who do ""bad"" things feeling full well that what they're doing is bad, most of the time they do ""bad"" thing because they feel that what they're doing is good.

Your idea of what's ""good"" or ""evil"" is completely ambiguous. Think mass murder and ethnic cleansing is wrong? Hitler didn't think so. Think bullying is wrong? The people who do don't think so. Think killing in the name of your beliefs is wrong? Terrorists don't think so. Think cannibalism is bad? Certain tribes in other countries might not think so. Think people like George Washington or Ulysses S. Grant were heroes? Other people might think otherwise.

Even in fiction this applies. The Jedi and Luke Skywalker were the bad guys from Darth Vader's perspective. Gandalf and the Fellowship were the villains from Sauron's perspective.

Concepts of good and bad are related entirely to an individuals beliefs and experiences. Moral objectivity cannot exist when people do bad things and feel they are right, since that's what the concept of moral objectivity needs to exist.

By contrast, **entrepreneurial debt** should be encouraged instead. I use this term to refer to the act of borrowing money, in exchange of interest or equity shares, with the goal of building a company or starting an activity that will yield utility in the long term.

**Why I believe consumer debt is bad**

When you borrow 100 dollars today from a bank, you are not actually borrowing from the bank. You are borrowing from the future version of yourself.

If you need to repay those 100 dollars after 1 year, yourself from 1 year later will have his wealth reduced by 100 dollars because he has to repay the debt you've made in the present. This alone forces him to rethink his lifestyle and tailor it to a smaller wealth, but it's actually worse because future you has to pay interest on the sum. This makes him even poorer.

So, if you generate debt today to purchase a 1000 dollars television, future you will have a television and 1000 dollars less in his pockets. 

I'll stop now and ask you to watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0) 30 minutes video from Ray Dalio, as it sheds more light on the subject.

If you don't feel like watching it, the gist is that if millions of people buy the television with debt they need to repay 1 year later, 1 year later we will have millions of people whose spending power has been reduced by 1000 dollars. This causes the world economy to take a substantial hit, especially when you consider that people generate debt for all sorts of useless things: low paying college degrees, expensive cars and accessories, large apartments and so on.

It's a cycle. We make ourselves richer in the present by making ourselves poorer in the future. 

Banning debt alltoghether would be obviously dumb, because debt can be an amazing tool. If I generate debt today to get a college degree that allows me to get a good paying job, I have made myself richer today by also making future me richer as well. If I generate debt to fund a business today, 1 year from now that business will generate even more money than what I originally borrowed.

**Conclusion:** I believe that, by banning consumer debt and encouraging entrepreneurial debt, the world economy would be a lot more stable. It wouldn't solve all its issues of course, since new companies fail and college graduates don't always get a good career, but it would definetely mitigate them.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;By &lt;strong&gt;consumer debt&lt;/strong&gt; I mean the act of borrowing money, in exchange for interest, with the goal of purchasing a good or service that provides utility in the short-term and does not improve your economical position in the long term. &lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

For example in Germany an election has to fulfill these 5 criteria. It must be: 

* universal (everyone\* can vote)
* direct ( no voting by proxy)
* free (free choice between all options)
* equal (each vote counts the same)
* secret (no one but yourself knows how you voted)

&amp;#x200B;

\* that is over 16/18 and is a citizen and or registered in that area. 

&amp;#x200B;

Where each of them serves an integral purpose. The first avoids 2nd class citizenship and being the subject of decisions without having any chance to affect those decisions legally. The second one is integral in having a vote at all and not having someone else decide ""what's best"" for you. Guess free choice is a no brainer. Equality is also fundamental as otherwise a person or region effectively leads rendering the claim of a democracy somewhat illegitimate. And secrecy basically ensures a plurality of the others, because if others knew how you voted they might peer pressure you into something else or reward or punish different voting styles and whatnot or that the next government keeps a registry of ""friends"" and ""enemies"".

One might also add a 6th criteria that is ""transparency of the process"", because if that isn't assured the secrecy can also backfire massively.

&amp;#x200B;

Either way, the problem that I see is that electronic voting, no matter how advanced the technology, can never simultaneously ensure both the equality  and the secrecy criteria. So here are a few examples:

&amp;#x200B;

Assume a vote is cast and completely randomized (like if written on an equal piece of paper, with the same pencil and marked in a non-identifiable way and then thrown in a vessel with much more papers looking exactly alike) so that neither the voter nor the people administrating the election can tell whom it belongs to. 

&amp;#x200B;

* If the algorithm is known, people can hack that and insert new votes that look similar to regular votes but change the outcome of the election and thereby violate the ""equal"" criteria. And while that could theoretically happen with any vote, the scale upon which that would be possible increases drastically and so do the angles of attack. There would be so many layers of encryption and transmission where you can interfere with the process and the easy-of-use is directly anti-proportional to the security of that process. 
* if the algorithm is not known, it's far more dangerous for outsiders to mess with it, but it makes it also far more easy for insiders to do so and far more difficult for outsiders to check it. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, whenever you tokenize a vote so that it becomes unique in order to prevent others from adding illegal votes, ... well that makes it unique. Meaning you can identify the person voting and the more advanced the technology gets, the easier that will be. So even if the vote is totally save at the time of the vote, within a few days, weeks or months or years, it will be possible to crack the code of who is who among the voters. Again if you make it public that data will be mined for information and if you keep it private that makes for a fishy election. 

&amp;#x200B;

And the last problem is that when you add even more layers of identification, anonymisation and randomization to the point where it would be theoretically be save and secret (which again I don't think will work, CMV), than you still have to reconcile that with the fact that this won't be any easier than having your votes cast on paper, would it?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that many people often claim that electronic voting makes it easy to make for all sorts of electronic elections and referendums, I&amp;#39;d counter that this is far more difficult and that even advancements in technology won&amp;#39;t actually solve the problem:&lt;/p&gt;

The amount you spend won’t necessarily change (given that you’re tipping properly). Another is that servers will be further incentivized to give good service if they are being tipped, but restaurant work shouldn’t be different that types of work where you’re not being tipped; if you’re a good employee, your performance should be good. The level of service you provide won’t necessarily change because you aren’t dependent on tips.

Servers are under a lot more pressure and stress than they might be if they knew they would have a guaranteed steady wage. Overall, it’s a strange practice and I think it’s ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the arguments against this are that it keeps prices lower, but hypothetically you’re just adding what you would normally pay as a tip onto the price of a meal. The amount you spend won’t necessarily change (given that you’re tipping properly). Another is that servers will be further incentivized to give good service if they are being tipped, but restaurant work shouldn’t be different that types of work where you’re not being tipped; if you’re a good employee, your performance should be good. The level of service you provide won’t necessarily change because you aren’t dependent on tips. I think the levels of stress and duress would also be lower, and the atmosphere of working in a restaurant would be far more pleasant without that added pressure. I think, overall, abolishing the practice of tipping seems the most efficient and logical thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

Many people have beliefs that a human being is more than just the body it inhabits, that we have a soul, or some underlying being behind our faces. Yet, if one is to think about the nature of life and consciousness deeply, it may become apparent that human beings are no different than objects. Bleak as it may sound, hear me out. An object is classically a thing composed of matter, which is thought to lack consciousness or awareness. Human beings are also composed of matter. From a purely rational standpoint, all that encompasses a human being is matter. It is all a human is. The atoms in our bodies are very intricate and assorted, adding up to create organs, veins, bones, and notably, brains. However, despite how complex our biology may be, one thing is certain. We are still a body composed of matter. To add anything else to that idea, such as a soul or underlying being of any sort, requires a deal of faith. Personally, I would conclude that faith without a rational reason is quite irrational, as would many. Many are able to find rationality in the idea that we have a soul, after all, we are *conscious and freethinking* right? Maybe we are aware of ourselves, maybe we have a sense of separation as a single entity, yet awareness and consciousness can be picked apart if you consider that these things are an illusion caused by an uncountable number of neurons firing in a lump of grey matter composed of material. All consciousness is simply that, electrical signals firing off at an incomprehensible level within an object. A very complex object is perfectly capable of becoming aware of itself, but none the less, it is an object. For example, if mankind created an artificial intelligence that was so advanced it were to become sentient, would you consider it alive? Likely not, even though its software/hardware would be much more complex than a human brain. At the same time, if nature created a biological organism and assorted its atoms into a brain with neurons that fire similar to binary over the course of millions of years (evolution) or billions of years (the big bang itself), the concepts would be the same. Only, one took much longer to come into existence. Due to an infinite seeming amount of time, it is actually quite unsurprising that matter would arrange itself into an object capable of experiencing the sensations by some way or another. Human beings, and life in general are simply that. A very low (yet high due to the age and vastness of the universe) probability took place a long time ago, and atoms arranged themselves into the first cells. These cells were capable simple reproduction and formation due to their makeup, and created the first living organisms. The most simple organisms consist of a very simple structure. Amoebas are single celled organisms with DNA that program it to preform a very simple tasks, to consume energy, and move away from death. Such an organism is subject to very basic programming, it lacks consciousness and awareness, yet it is ""alive"", even though it is a very simple organic object. A basic artificial robot may as well be the same as it. It also lacks awareness, yet it is programmed to do very basic tasks. The same line of thinking can be applied to human beings on a more complex level. We are the same in nature as an amoeba, except our tasks are much more diverse than any objective life form due to our brains. One of these tasks includes the illusion of consciousness and ego. Perhaps all of this does not do the explanation justice, therefore, I will attempt to explain it through analogy, and go in depth on how this effects our freedom of choice.

Imagine you were to take a small palm sized ball. You throw this ball at a wall, it bounces off, and lands on the floor in a certain position. Imagine you were to take that same ball, which is identical in atomic structure, and throw it with identical force in the exact same direction, and have it hit the same part of the wall, and bounce off in the same direction it did previously. Imagine that every single variable in that experiment was replicated perfectly, right down to the air molecules hitting it mid air. A rational mind would say that the ball would land in the exact same position it did the first time. The ball had no say in the matter, and the variables had predestined where it would end up. Now, imagine you took a human and said a sentence to them, ""Hello, how are you?"". The vibration of your vocal cords and the movement of your mouth generated a specific wave in the air, which traveled to their ear drums and caused them to vibrate. This vibration sent an electrical signal to the brain and warranted a neurological response, and the individual processed the words you said, and responded to them. In this case, there are far more many variables involved in the experiment, perhaps out of the realms of calculation, yet a solution underlies and they respond anyway. If you were to completely erase all recollection of the memory the person just formed about this interaction (or you were to rewind time for the sake of argument), and sit them down in the same position, and say the exact same words with the exact same tone and body language, and once again, replicate every variable perfectly, the very neurons in their brain would react the same way, and they would exhibit the same response they did the first time. ""I'm good, and you?"". Once again, if you were to replicate everything perfectly, the object of the brain would behave exactly the same, and it would have a predestined response. Through this example, we see that an object, and the human brain that creates your consciousness and awareness are the same in nature. Every single response, reaction, and emotion, you have ever given or experienced in your entire life was purely a product of your environment, just as me writing this post was, and you reading it was.

I do not mean environment as in the area you grew up in, or the culture you were born into either. I am referring to the fundamental environment that shaped all environments. I am talking about the big bang. From the very origins of our universe, there was matter and energy. When basic atoms had formed, they underwent a series of collisions and interacted with each other for around 14 billion years, somewhere in that time period, stars and planets formed, and eventually life here on Earth. This mind breaking amount of time yielded an incomprehensible amount of variables that could never possibly be displayed fully in a human lifetime, yet they happened. A solution was underlying all of the atomic collisions, celestial interactions, explosions, and everything else. That ""solution"" continues to be uncovered as time passes, and human life, as well as everything else is a part of it. Hypothetically, if you were to create another universe with identical initial conditions and laws of physics to this one, everything would play out exactly the same. That play out would eventually result in me and you 14 billion years later once again, just as the ball would land in the same place. Essentially, **everything** is predestined, right to the end of this space and time me and you currently inhabit. The freedom of choice could not possibly exist in such a complex series of predestined events. The freedom of choice, in a way, encompasses what humanity is. People go around and boast about how they are unique and special because they are human, because humans have the power of reason, the power of choice, the power of consciousness, yet in the grand grand scheme of things, all of these things are actually illusions. I have tried to explain this idea to many, yet so many unknowingly follow the ego they were predestined to have, and dismiss this logic, quote: ""But you still have a choice!"". Perhaps in a very myopic and narrow sense, but in the greater picture, it is evident that this is not true.

If this post has shed any light on to you, hopefully it does not distress you. I personally think it is very fulfilling knowing that external to my sense of ego, I do not have to stress about my inadequacies because my life, as well as yours are written for us already. I also feel very blessed to have been in the chance of events that gave me my advantages, including my brain that is capable of decoding existence, whether I am an object or not. Although we may not be special in a greater sense, you can look at things in a sense of duality. Either everything is, or nothing is. I prefer to abide by the first. Perhaps this is all a belief, but if so, I ""believe"" it to hold a large amount of merit, rationality, and fundamental truth. Hopefully you feel the same. If not, I would be happy to hear any thoughts you have that give a sense of understanding to our nature in an effort to change my view. Maybe you might even have something to add to this. Anyway, I have a destiny to go play out, thank you for reading!

EDIT 2; The best argument I have encountered so far is that of quantum mechanics, which may suggest that events may play out differently if time were to rewind due to inherent randomness. While such would no longer be deterministic, I have came to the conclusion that deterministic or random, both would warrant free will meaningless, as one depends on predestined events, and the other depends on probabilities that would warrant free will meaningless a second time if the choice was different, as that would mean it had no meaning the first time. The more I engage with the users in the comments, the clearer it becomes that free will and free choice is a human made concept that does not really have deep fundamental grounds to even be argued upon. Regardless, the conversations have been immensely stimulating and thought provoking, and I thank everyone who took the time to challenge my idea (even if it was out of your control in a deeper sense, haha). Perhaps we need the concept of free will in the common sense term associated with it in order to have a functioning society, while slightly illogical from a cosmic standpoint. An important concept no less, yet still an illusion in a way. You did spark some doubt in my theory of absolute determinism though, I guess you all changed my view in that way.

I would rather come across as an overly wordy crackpot to some, than to never really be understood by any.)

Coming at this from a very hardliner utilitarian viewpoint. If person A owns $5, but giving it to person B would result in more Utility for B than the Utility keeping it would yield to person A, then it is Good for A to give B the money; not doing so—while being apprised of every fact of the two hypothetical continuations, to give or not to give—is for A to deem that his happiness is worth more than B's. Even if A ""earned that money fair and square.""

I believe this principle applies to any scale of wealth, $5 or $5 thousand or $5 million. Yet, this is at odds with the fact that virtually nobody in the developed world is comfortable with donating more than crumbs (and those who *do* donate crumbs are actually quite generous, relatively speaking) to needy strangers, i.e. highly cost-efficient Utility generators. To try to keep this as abstract as possible—since I think human happiness is the most, perhaps *only* valuable moral asset in this world—I'll just call them HCEUGs.

To respond to the ""forehead-slappingly obvious"" objections to this extreme viewpoint:

1. ""Do you really think we ought to funnel billions or trillions of dollars to Africa/the wartorn Middle East/the ghettos/etc. just to be kind? That will exacerbate their problems and ultimately light the world on fire for reasons X, Y, Z..."" Of course P-then-Q, but I'm not advocating P to begin with, even if you extrapolate my individualistic moral philosophy to a global trend. This is one of the reasons I prefer to refer to the individuals and their circumstances as HCEUGs, and only when they *really are* HCEUGs. If a middle-classer giving a random homeless guy a crisp $1000 is just going to result in a stereotypical ""blow it all on booze"" night out, then that is a contradiction of his very hypothesis as a HCEUG; Utility is not just a short-term hedonistic thing. There are plenty of people out there among the 7.5 billion who *are* verifiably true HCEUGs (or at least, more cost efficient utility generators than you), and they don't have to be prodigal drug addicts, or welfare queens, or ""third-worlders for whom large cash infusions result in overpopulation and political strife,"" or what have you. Moreover, your wealth need not be granted as a lump sum to one source; diversification is second only to information when it comes to managing risk.

2. I'm not implying any sort of legal *obligations* to determine who gives charitable money to whom, or much less vigilante Robinhood-ism; that's obviously 1000x less defensible an idea. I'm simply concerned with what I see as the only morally consistent course of action for a person to take regarding their own wealth.

3. ""Why should this moral imperative be relevant to anyone but the 1%? They're *way* more extravagant and wasteful with their resources, and they would have much more of an impact!"" True, but just because they're capable of causing more good doesn't mean that the good you're capable of causing isn't, well, good. We are to HCEUGs what the Hiltons are to us.

4. ""Have *you* given most of your wealth away? Or are you just a hypocrite?"" Even if I was, would it impact the truth of the idea? ""No, but it would mean you're being disingenuous somewhere."" Committing to something like giving almost all my wealth away requires &gt;99.9% certainty of the rightfulness of my action. If I were so certain, I wouldn't be on r/CMV. As it stands, nobody else seems to even believe on principle in this kind of extremist egalitarian charity, much less act on it. I'm already expecting derision from this post. Maybe if a thousand people tell me I'm drunk, I best lie down.

5. (Retroactively edited in) ""Surely someone like Andrew Carnegie can make more out of $1 than some random HCEUG?"" If you believe in such edge cases, then yes, Andrew Carnegie is free to hoard all the money he wants. To the extent that he actually benefits humanity with his charity, I think he himself is a HCEUG. But his case is either nonexistent or rare, in my view.

Yet, this is at odds with the fact that virtually nobody in the developed world is comfortable with donating more than crumbs (and those who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; donate crumbs are actually quite generous, relatively speaking) to needy strangers, i.e. highly cost-efficient Utility generators. To try to keep this as abstract as possible—since I think human happiness is the most, perhaps &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; valuable moral asset in this world—I&amp;#39;ll just call them HCEUGs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To respond to the &amp;quot;forehead-slappingly obvious&amp;quot; objections to this extreme viewpoint:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do you really think we ought to funnel billions or trillions of dollars to Africa/the wartorn Middle East/the ghettos/etc. just to be kind? That will exacerbate their problems and ultimately light the world on fire for reasons X, Y, Z...&amp;quot; Of course P-then-Q, but I&amp;#39;m not advocating P to begin with, even if you extrapolate my individualistic moral philosophy to a global trend. This is one of the reasons I prefer to refer to the individuals and their circumstances as HCEUGs, and only when they &lt;em&gt;really are&lt;/em&gt; HCEUGs. If a middle-classer giving a random homeless guy a crisp $1000 is just going to result in a stereotypical &amp;quot;blow it all on booze&amp;quot; night out, then that is a contradiction of his very hypothesis as a HCEUG; Utility is not just a short-term hedonistic thing. There are plenty of people out there among the 7.5 billion who &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; verifiably true HCEUGs (or at least, more cost efficient utility generators than you), and they don&amp;#39;t have to be prodigal drug addicts, or welfare queens, or &amp;quot;third-worlders for whom large cash infusions result in overpopulation and political strife,&amp;quot; or what have you. Moreover, your wealth need not be granted as a lump sum to one source; diversification is second only to information when it comes to managing risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not implying any sort of legal &lt;em&gt;obligations&lt;/em&gt; to determine who gives charitable money to whom, or much less vigilante Robinhood-ism; that&amp;#39;s obviously 1000x less defensible an idea. I&amp;#39;m simply concerned with what I see as the only morally consistent course of action for a person to take regarding their own wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why should this moral imperative be relevant to anyone but the 1%? They&amp;#39;re &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more extravagant and wasteful with their resources, and they would have much more of an impact!&amp;quot; True, but just because they&amp;#39;re capable of causing more good doesn&amp;#39;t mean that the good you&amp;#39;re capable of causing isn&amp;#39;t, well, good. We are to HCEUGs what the Hiltons are to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Have &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; given most of your wealth away? Or are you just a hypocrite?&amp;quot; Even if I was, would it impact the truth of the idea? &amp;quot;No, but it would mean you&amp;#39;re being disingenuous somewhere.&amp;quot; Committing to something like giving almost all my wealth away requires &amp;gt;99.9% certainty of the rightfulness of my action. If I were so certain, I wouldn&amp;#39;t be on &lt;a href=""/r/CMV""&gt;r/CMV&lt;/a&gt;. As it stands, nobody else seems to even believe on principle in this kind of extremist egalitarian charity, much less act on it. I&amp;#39;m already expecting derision from this post. Maybe if a thousand people tell me I&amp;#39;m drunk, I best lie down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Retroactively edited in) &amp;quot;Surely someone like Andrew Carnegie can make more out of $1 than some random HCEUG?&amp;quot; If you believe in such edge cases, then yes, Andrew Carnegie is free to hoard all the money he wants. To the extent that he actually benefits humanity with his charity, I think he himself is a HCEUG. But his case is either nonexistent or rare, in my view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;God doesn&amp;#39;t exist. Morality is overrated. Life sucks. Get over it.&amp;quot; Duly noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

first , judging someone for what they like imo is very fair , for example if a guy likes to wear make up i think judging him for it is very fair  due to the fact that guys who wear make up are not accepted in society therefor the guy being rejected by people by what he likes will affect him and his personality which will most likely me a negative effect thus the guy will maybe be an unlikeable irritating person toxic behaviors toward other ( even if its unintentiona)l   ect  cause of what happens to him 

same can go with gays or anyone in the lgbt , they get affected by their rejection therefore making them annoying and toxic people ect
( and yes they can act like that inententionaly )
&amp;#x200B;

also what someone likes can easily represents their personality / way if thinking /inner self 

like if i know an old guy who like to watch something like my little pony and collects body pillows if the characters judging him and assuming that wants to make a relation with an irl horse is very fair  same can goes to someone who draws naked animals ect , and thats imply that that person is weird  ect

I think impeachment is highly unlikely, but it is possible for sure. But people keep talking about criminal prosecution, and its just not going to happen, it really is so damned unlikely. Just the facts. No President has been arrested before Grant was arrested for riding a horse through a town too fast, and none have since. Not once, not well President, and not after. No President has ever seen the inside of a courtroom well President or after without exception. The practical fact Presidents are above the law is logically something they all value, and I will bet anyone I know 10 to 1 that the next President, in either party, will pardon Trump and weather the political storm, just as Ford pardoned Nixon. 

And any political storm from a pardon will likely be a small one as people will be so glad to have Trump gone and glad to be done with the issue.

I think impeachment is highly unlikely, but it is possible for sure. But people keep talking about criminal prosecution, and its just not going to happen, it really is so damned unlikely. Just the facts. No President has been arrested before Grant was arrested for riding a horse through a town too fast, and none have since. Not once, not well President, and not after. No President has ever seen the inside of a courtroom well President or after without exception. The practical fact Presidents are above the law is logically something they all value, and I will bet anyone I know 10 to 1 that the next President, in either party, will pardon Trump and weather the political storm, just as Ford pardoned Nixon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And any political storm from a pardon will likely be a small one as people will be so glad to have Trump gone and glad to be done with the issue.

2. The belief that sneezing stops the heart (so God should be thanked that you didn't die.) This is not true.
3. As protection from the plague.

Considering that all three of these reasons are either debunked or no longer relevant, I don't can't see a truly meaningful purpose of saying ""bless you"" in a polite manner.

Then the sneezer says ""thank you."" The disruption of the meeting from the sneeze was nearly nothing, but adding the unnecessary speaking to it makes it a real (however small) distraction from the meeting. Plus it just makes me cringe no matter when it's said.

I will concede that saying bless you does make sense when used in a comedic sense. If someone let's a real monster of a sneeze go that disrupts the situation in a humorous manner, it makes sense to react to it, and saying something like bless you serves the situation by adding comedy, but that's rare, and that's not the tradition that I'm attacking.

I also understand people saying that ""bless you"" is like saying ""you're excused"" or ""no problem"" in response to someone saying excuse me.

But this isn't about Mike Pence specifically, it's about a way to prevent crooked candidates from picking terrible VPs that will make their impeachment less likely because everyone is scared of the backup President. I think the US should move to electing the VP individually, instead of the two positions being linked together.

Because you can't have a P and VP from different parties due to the possibility of assassination, that would mean everyone would have to vote for both a Democrat and a Republican (and third parties too, although I think it's likely most people would skip that part), and the VP winner who belonged to the party of the winning P would be the one to take office.

PROS:

1. The VP would probably not be so terrible. Do you really think that the voters would have picked Pence on their own, or Cheney, or Biden? (The last one did so badly in his Presidential run that he only won a single delegate.) We have had a lot of terrible VPs lately, and Pence in particular is basically Trump's life insurance.
2. It would encourage voters to read up on the other party's candidates and positions which might decrease political polarization. It might also decrease polarization because the candidates would have to win votes from both sides, so they'd have to reach across the aisle on some issues. A far-right or far-left candidate would have no chance because there'd be zero crossover.
3. It's just fairer. Most voters are choosing the President and the VP is just an afterthought, but the VP has ascended to the Presidency around 20% of the time. It's reasonable to believe that the President you voted in will die or be assassinated in office. Yes, the VP is technically elected now, but only as part of a package deal. If the VP were elected on their own ticket and the President dies, at least we'll know that the person in office actually won their seat on their own merits.

CONS:

1. VPs would trend toward being centrists, since you'd have to appeal both to the voters from your own party and that of the other. You could fix this by weighing the votes differently based on voter alignment (so if the Dem President wins, every Dem vote would be worth 1.5 Republican votes, or vice versa), but that would require putting party information on the ballots which would decrease their secrecy. I also don't like the idea of some people's votes counting more than others.
2. Might lead to voter fatigue. I follow politics very closely, but not everyone is like me and if voters have to care about two other elections besides the one for President and whatever other offices are being voted on that cycle, they might just tune out completely and not vote. We already have such a low voter participation rate in this country.
3. If the VP were elected by a considerably larger margin than their corresponding President, there might be calls for the President to step down since the country was clearly way more united behind the VP. Although that might not be such a terrible thing.

I know that none of this will actually happen since it would require MAJOR rewriting of the Constitution. But for the sake of the fantasy government I'm setting up in my head, does this idea hold water? Or is it just completely stupid for a reason I'm not seeing?

Well the official definition of sport is an activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others for entertainment.

With that definition you can directly apply it to E-Sports. It is physical in that the games being played require good hand eye coordination, dexterity and stamina. It might not be as physical as other traditional sports, but it is physical nonetheless. The games being played for competition aren't your casual games like Red Dead, Skyrim or GTA. They are highly competitive games like Fortnite, Madden, NBA2k, COD, etc. They require constant practice before and after the competition and believe me not everyone can hang with the big boys. I feel like I'm pretty good on the sticks with 2K. But if I try to play online I get creamed. There's guys not actually competing professionally that put in more time daily than I do. Those games require skill. You can't win every match on luck alone.

So iI definitely feel like E-Sports is a legitimate sport. You don't necessarily have to watch it or care about it, I know I'm not interested in it.

You *must* vote.

Why?

Here are what I feel are legitimate reasons as to why someone might not want to vote

1. **I don't want to support any of the individual candidates with my vote**. I haven't felt strongly enough about any of the parties or candidates.
2. **I don't believe that my vote counts for anything due to the voting system in place.** In Britain we have a first-past-the-post system. Live in a particular party stronghold? You might as well just close your eyes and draw an 'X'
3. **I don't feel that I know enough about the possible outcomes of the election**. If I don't understand or care about the implications of my vote then it's frankly irresponsible for me to cast a vote.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some of the common arguments I've seen and acknowledged but haven't changed my mind.

1. **Spoil your ballot paper.** This process seems simply arbitrary and petty.
2. **""If you don't vote, you can't complain"".** This is my most hated political platitude. To me it's not far off being pure social manipulation in order to get you to adhere to the system and force you into an opinion. See reasons above. A vote shouldn't ever be considered as means to buy an opinion.
3. **Some countries don't have democracy/people died for your right.** I have voted before and am a full supporter of democracy. I wholeheartedly appreciate those who have fought for my right to be free. I feel that my right not to vote is equal to my right to vote, this isn't a 'but', they are mutually exclusive in my eyes. Being forced to vote by any means is undemocratic.
4. **There's no excuse to feel disenfranchised, it's your responsibility to educate yourself.** This I agree with, though I don't see it as any legitimate reason as to why I should vote. I can educate myself on and assess all the candidates and still not want to vote for any of them.

&amp;#x200B;

As per the rules of this sub, I am here to have my mind changed, I'd just like a logical reason why I'm wrong to feel the way I do.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I didn't expect so many replies. I'm trying to read them all. It's great this has sparked such good discussion. I feel that I need to clarify a few things so I'm leaving the edit at the top in order to prevent confusion.

1. ""I don't feel that I know enough"" is a self-acknowledgement that the individual does not know enough come election day and therefore, imo is responsible not to vote in that circumstance. This does not tie in to ""if you don't vote, you can't complain"" as I don't see why this person should vote at random in order to be entitled to 'complain'. Do I think they should complain? Would be weird if they did. Should I *refuse* to respect their opinion because they didn't vote? Absolutely not, I respect someone who admits they just don't know. That's a favourable outcome to me.
2. I'm seeing a lot of comments along the lines of 'not voting = not caring'.  A vote should not buy you a right to complain in a democracy, you should have that right already. You should not have to vote in order to care or take part, the logic just isn't there.

Edit II:

1. Still seeing comments about supposedly 'not caring'. I can only see this as an emotional respose so it's not that helpful. Also there's a lot of nitpicking over my reasons why someone might not vote (""define ignorant"" has been posted numerous times), instead of reasons why the individual should. 
2. I'm most convinced that should I not know who to vote for I should spoil my ballot. I'm surprised that it wasn't brought up more. Despite me calling it petty, to me it makes the most sense. I'm leaving the house and participating (so I earn my complaint token), I've done my research and still not felt that I can morally cross a box. Most of the replies have been in annoyance that I haven't *picked a side* and that there's no excuse for not having *picked a side.* I think that's really poor.

**Conclusion:** *""Don't vote, can't complain""*. I don't actually think that voting gives you any more legitimate means to complain. Brexit is a prime example. If you voted to Remain in the EU you are labelled a 'Remoaner' or a 'loser', you're told that you cannot complain about the outcome of a democratic vote, in the worst case, people have been described as traitors for protesting the outcome of the referendum. A vote buys you nothing in that situation. Also, if you didn't vote in an election, you may well regret it, there is no logical reason why your opinion is invalid. Where does that logic end? 

Going forward I probably won't opt to abstain from an election. Spoiling my ballot is the way to go when I'm on the fence. I do care, I do pay attention, I do wish to excercise my right, I don't however think I need to pick a side if I really can't.

Still, bias can appear through the definition of what is ""civil"", effectively opening the door to banning a specific type of substance. So this is already a fine line to thread.

Considering banning speech based on its ""veracity"" is a whole new step. The truth is no easy thing to find, and the entire profession of journalism consists in trying to uncover it. The diversity of reports (and their various political affiliations) shows that we can't formulate a single, satisfying, ""truth"". As long as this is the case, it is paramount that people have access to all variations of reports. Banning some variations and allowing the publication of only one given truth is a practice typically used by totalitarian states.

Some statements are so factual in their formulation (e.g. a claim that a murder has took place in some place at some time) that it is reasonable to consider that they're not up to any interpretation, and that they must simply be either true or false. I agree with this impression, however I believe that regulating the publication of such facts brings risks that aren't worth the benefits (the benefits in question are that people are better-informed). In fact I believe the benefits are very short-sighted whereas the risks are dangerous on the long-term.

The first risk is the introduction of bias in the implementation of the regulation. To create such regulation, you first need to define what is factual and what is not. Factual things are statement that can either be true or false and about which you want to ban false statements. Non-factual things are higher-level reports that are up to interpretation and should not be regulated for reasons explained previously. Unfortunately, what is factual and what is not is itself a consideration up to interpretation, such that the sole act of basing a regulation on a given interpretation would already a ban on other interpretations of this question. In practice, the political party having the control of the said regulation could model the definition of ""factual"" to put in it things that could be argued are actually more subtle.

The second risk is nurturing the lack of intelligence of the people. The reason fake news work is because people are not educated enough to check out more legitimate sources of information, too impulsive to be triggered by news playing on their fears, or simply lack the critical mind to doubt claims made by whatever they read on the Internet. The health of democracy relies on the people *not* behaving like that, so it is very important that those problems are solved. The strategy of regulating online platforms' news assume people are automatons that simply regurgitate what they read online and should therefore be fed ""proper facts"" so that they would then vote properly. This does not actually empower the people at all, because their essence of being automatons has not been solved. We could actually argue that it is hidden and even nurtured.

This does not actually empower the people at all, because their essence of being automatons has not been solved. We could actually argue that it is hidden and even nurtured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: facts regulation is a slippery slope to politically-manipulated truths; people should know better anyway&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The [majority of Americans](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-change-in-the-american-mind-december-2018/) both believe that climate change is human-caused and express concern for it. There is also [ample evidence](https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/) that climate change is happening, as supported by both foreign and domestic research bodies and universities.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration vehemently [denies climate change](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46351940), has elected a [former coal lobbyist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_R._Wheeler) to head the EPA, pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement, scrapped clean energy, relaxed regulations meant to protect clean water, air, and wildlife, and have opened up public lands and national monuments for mining and drilling, despite protests. ([source](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/02/15-ways-trump-administration-impacted-environment/)). Just yesterday, in a truly ridiculous move, they tried to re-brand natural gas as 'freedom gas' and fuel as '[molecules of freedom](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/29/energy-department-molecules-freedom-fossil-fuel-rebranding)'.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**I believe there are three main advantages to focusing on climate change:**

1. (Relatively) Non-Controversial

While there are still some people that don't believe in climate change, public opinion is moving in support of environmental protections. Compared to other issues such as immigration, 'identity' politics, or economic prosperity where each side of the debate can produce meaningful evidence, climate change denial has no meaningful evidence to support it.Beyond this, the fundamental idea behind climate change-- that we want to protect the trees and animals and keep water clean-- is ultimately a good thing that pretty much everyone wants. No one argues that keeping the world looking pretty and keeping polar bears alive is a good idea, some people just argue about whether or not making an effort is worth it. Arguing about the specifics of environmental policy could be difficult, however...

2. Trump has made it easy to debate

By taking such a strong stance against the existence of climate change, the Trump administration has made this an easy debate topic because they have an effectively negative environmental policy. By selling out national monuments for drilling, the Trump administration has effectively said that they don't care about keeping all the little trees and animals happy. They're basically Cruella de Vil. As they have taken such as strong stance, it makes it easy for the Democrats to debate against because they wont get stuck in complex policy arguments. Voters will not need to decide on who has the best environmental policy-- they just need to decide between one party which denies science and another party that does not deny science.

3. It can bring fringe voters to the Democratic side

The largest 3rd party platform is the Green Party, defined exclusively by their support of environmentalism. It has long been believed that Green Party voters act as 'spoilers' for Democratic victory-- if the Democrats can bring them in on this issue, it can strengthen their base. It can also help to get younger voters more involved in the political process, both in voting but also in campaigning or spreading campaign awareness.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Furthermore, I believe a** ***failure*** **to adequately address climate change could have equally disastrous effects:**

1. Candidates can become stuck in controversial debates that open them up to more criticism. It isn't as if they can avoid talking about the economy forever, but they can at least change the ratio to be somewhat more in their favor.
2. Democrats may continue to alienate the Green Party and environmental voters, as well as many young voters, by not giving adequate coverage to issues that these groups believe to not only be vital, but also life or death.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**And finally, there are a few pit falls that could trap the Democrats,** but I think they can adequately address them without losing their base:

1. Taxes

The best talking point Republicans could bring up against climate change policy is the fear of rising taxes, specifically a carbon tax. Yes, a carbon tax would be the most effective route and no it wouldn't really affect the 'every man' voter, but raises in taxes don't sell well, historically.Instead though, Democrats can at least get the ball rolling by *not* proposing a carbon tax but instead proposing the re-zoning of national monuments to not be available for drilling/mining, removing oil lobbyists from positions of power in the EPA, promoting jobs in the new renewable energy sector etc. Thankfully the Trump administration has made it pretty easy to take pro-environmental measures that aren't a controversial carbon tax.

2. China

A big issue in regards to things like the Paris Accord or climate change may be that it is ultimately futile to act while big polluters like China don't do anything. However, this is factually not true.Though China is still a [big polluter,](https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/china/) they are still actively trying to brand themselves as 'forward thinking' in climate change and trying to lead the race is development of new green technology. By re-branding the climate debate to be one of *international competition* and *global excellence*, the Democrats could effectively divert criticism about it being 'useless to do anything' because they would be drawing attention to China's efforts in a compelling way while simultaneously promoting proactive action in climate change.

Furthermore, if people continue to worry about efforts being futile because the rest of the world won't participate, Democrats can also fall back on patriotic statements about how the US needs to lead the charge, etc.(It should be noted that thought China has more CO2 emissions than the US in total, the US has about x3 more CO2 emissions *per capita*. However, bringing this up is probably not the best way to inspire a voting base, even if it is true, so I haven't touched on it here).

&amp;#x200B;

So, am I wrong?

I'd like to know any flaws in my arguments, as I don't want to be erroneously supporting a weak position. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I do believe they're two separate things. I love, for example, the ""Batman Forever"" movie, but I think it's a bad movie. That is a dissonance in quality and my enjoyment (what's normally called ""guilty pleasure""), but I still believe they're both subjective.

Why do I? Well, for starters, if art were objective, there would be clear guidelines as to what makes a movie good or bad, and there would be no need for different reviews. There would be an organization that would determine objectively its quality, without possible disagreement. I believe that, despite people asking reviewers to be objective or getting mad when they think they weren't, the only objective things you can say about a movie are true proven facts, like the name of the film, the director, the techniques used, the length... The rest is subjective, and it comes from two things:

- Criteria: There's no specific criteria por every film. There are some a majority of us can agree on, like ""Plot needs to be interesting"", or ""Sci-fi action movies must have stunning visuals"". Still, someone could argue there's no need for that to make a good movie.

- Adherence to that already subjective criteria: Let's take we all agree on ""Good plot"" as a criteria for movies. Now, how is objective what means a plot is good or bad? Some people may hate coincidences and feel they only make for contrived plots, and a contrived plot is a bad plot. Another one may differ and give more importance to, say, character arcs. Even if both agreed on plot holes being a bad thing, one of them can think a certain plot hole is huge and another one might overlook it. 

That's why art could never be objective. There's too many things to take into account that subjectivity almost gets in the way, and our personal understanding will always be determinant for our opinion. It's not even about, as some people say, the art managing to reach the author's goal. Why should it be like that?

**Reasoning:**

* It's currently unconstitutional for the government (or state) to enact any law which limits individual liberties (e.g. the liberty to decide what you do with your body).
* This is thanks to the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution.
* This is the protection which prevents abortion bans along with other laws which might force people to do stuff with their body against their will.
* In order to ban abortions, an exception for life-preservation must be interpreted into this 14th Amendment protection (assuming no new Constitutional Amendment)
* If life-preservation becomes an exception to this 14th Amendment's protection of individual liberties, the government will be Constitutionally allowed to limit individual liberties for the purpose of life-preservation.
* This means that life-saving donations can be mandated by law as well as full-term pregnancies.

**Explained another way:**

In the US, it's currently unconstitutional for states to ban abortions because of the 14th Amendment, which prevents the government from limiting any citizen's liberty.  In the case of banned abortions, the liberty is that a woman can decide what she does with her body.  This was decided by SCOTUS in the famous Roe v Wade case.

Some states are trying to overturn Roe v Wade (and similar decisions) in an effort to ban abortions.

If that happens, and the government is allowed to limit citizens' liberties to preserve human life, then laws could be written to mandate life-saving donations.

**For example, the new liberty-limiting laws may:**

* Force Jane to give birth so that another may live.
* Force Joseph to give a kidney so that another may live.
* Force Jennifer to give blood so that another may live.
* Force John to give bone marrow so that another may live.

To clarify: I am not arguing that these life-preserving mandations (i.e. laws) will be enacted, but rather that the Constitutional barrier, which currently prevents these mandations, will be gone.

Because this is a sensitive topic:   
**I am not arguing for or against the morality of abortions,** and I'll ignore replies of this vein. Nor will I entertain discussions about the morality of forced donations.

The whole issue cruxes on the climax of the movie, which is the moment when the boats finally arrive and the men on the beach are saved.

But again, they don't care about their life. And their thought will simply fade as they die. 


So, is it humane to persistently asks human to not kill themselves, when they wanted to do it? They want release from what they perceive as their suffering, and we are stopping them just for other people, who may or may not be impacted. Plus if they do care, these thought to kill themselves would not even appear as they will enjoy their life in the mortal coil. The people around them is the one that can change their mind before they reach the breaking point where they want to kill themselves. If we are just going on the remark of consent, should you save people that wanted to kill themselves? Even using the word ""save"" is implying that we are doing something that stops them from something worse, which may not be the case.


Only reason that I can think of objectively is either because it can impact productivity in the long run, either because of the propagation of suicide and thus decrease workforce, and the people that kill themselves are reducing the population, which can reduce the workforce in their own rights. Either just in case of amount of labour, or skills that they have because of the time that is put in. Therefore there are incentive for government or people around them to stop them from killing themselves. But even then it’s society-centric way to look at it, as the reason why they should not kill themselves is because of sum of impact to society, which is a selfish thing to do. These people are in pain, and we are going to stop them from killing themselves because it impacts us? Seems like a selfish thing to do.


Other view that can be taken is we can try to convince these people to not kill themselves even if they are dead set on it, because people can change their mind. But if they don’t want it, and they does not consent to these attempts to change them, should an attempt be done? Of course, some may see this as a cry for help, and they wanted to see if there are people that wanted to force themselves to help them, going out of boundary of consent, showing that “I will do everything in power to stop you from killing yourself, cause I want you to live, period”. But even then, surely there are others who does not view it that way, and simply wanted to kill themselves. Should an effort be made then?


Or perhaps, should it be a calculated effort to see if a person should be saved or not, ranging from their social impact, their feelings, pain index and many more, to decide whether that person should be saved or not. If you have any opinion or argument, please do tell below. I am interested to see and hear what you say, as this has been on my mind for a few days now.


Side note:
I want to say that we should celebrate the act of people killing themselves, but people don’t really kill themselves unless they are in a negative state of mind, either because of what can be seen or cannot be seen, which I believe imply that they are in pain. So a celebration of others pain, even if it can be seen as ultimate exercise in choosing your life and consent, is a juxtaposition of the idea of happy celebration. Like celebrating people who are in pain as the focus seems like a contradictory thing.


Also, I believe I am not in danger of committing suicide. Or maybe some of you can see this as a cry for help, which I don’t believe is the case. I hope that all the effort in the discussion below is beneficial to the discussion regarding the topic.

&amp;#x200B;

Premise 1: Humans are morally superior to animals. (i.e. human moral value &gt;&gt; animal moral value)

We need this premise because I don't think you can plausibly argue that animal suffering is not morally bad in and of itself (e.g. by arguing from cognitive capacity). Instead, I'll argue that animal suffering, while bad, is justifiable because humans benefit and they're more morally valuable.

I essentially believe that humans should be given more moral consideration than animals because they have a higher-order moral capacity (to me, this is what gives humans moral value, not sentience). In particular, moral tendencies observable in animals are what I believe to be evolutionary -- things like altruism, retribution for cheating, and in-group loyalty can be explained by evolutionary influences in frameworks of self-selection (e.g. reciprocity), kin selection (optimizing offspring survival), or group selection (optimizing tribe survival). What differentiates humans is that they are able to consider morality and ethics independently from or counter to the evolutionary context. This includes fields like aesthetics and topics like veganism, abortion, slavery, and war. Animals do not consider the rights and experience of their rivals or prey. Surely, then, animals are not comparable in (intrinsic, moral, etc.) value to humans; a world without humans would be undeniably and categorically worse than a world without any other species on earth. In sum, this is the basis for the supposition that human benefit might justify animal suffering, even in the case where the degrees are unbalanced (e.g. moderate human benefit vs. extreme animal suffering).

&amp;#x200B;

Premise 2: By virtue of human benefit, non-vegan foods have moral value.

My argument for this will be independent of any considerations of nutritional requirements or costs related to vegan and non-vegan foods, because frankly I don't think those arguments are particularly convincing. Yes, the poorest people can and often do end up subsisting on mostly rice, (soy)beans, lentils, and home-grown veg. I question the notion that gustatory considerations have no value in the debate (i.e. we like meat and cake, fam).

Sub-premise A: Human enjoyment is morally valuable.

Since humans are morally valuable, human enjoyment is a moral good (just as human suffering is a moral bad). Pretty uncontroversial I think.

Sub-premise B: Things that facilitate human enjoyment are morally valuable. EDIT: *assuming that no other relevant moral considerations apply (e.g. the moral sadist)*

Follows from A. A good painting, a good movie, and well-designed or culturally significant building. All these things have moral value by virtue of the fact that humans enjoy them (aside: this also conveniently explains why it might be okay to eat a wild cat, but not my cat).

Sub-premise C: Non-vegan foods are a core component of human gustatory enjoyment for a not-insignificant portion of people.

I think this one is pretty non-controversial as well. The 6x growth of meat consumption in China from 1980-2015 is an anecdotal illustration of the fact that when they can afford to do so, people actively choose to move from vegan to non-vegan options for reasons not related to nutrition or economics (i.e. gustatory). For many people, vegan alternatives are not satisfactory (have you ever had a vegan pizza?) substitutes for the flavors and qualities of non-vegan items (by qualities, I'm mostly thinking of alternatives to dairy, especially in baking). For some people (read: me), some of the best foods out there are non-vegan -- tartare, sushi, steak, foie-gras. Thus...

Sub-premise D: Non-vegan foods are morally valuable.

Follows from B and C. Furthermore, since this value is tied to (and is derived from) the enjoyment of humans, it is a value close to that of the actual moral value of humans.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion: The suffering of animals involved in mass food production is morally justified; veganism is not morally obligated.

From premises 1 and 2, it follows that non-vegan foods have a moral value in excess of animals, and more broadly, that the enjoyment humans derive from non-vegan foods justifies the suffering of animals involved in their procurement.

&amp;#x200B;

In closing, I'd like to point out what I believe to be an important nuance: since we never deny that animal suffering is bad, the situation where a person can choose between two equivalent items sourced via different levels of animal suffering, the one that reduces suffering is always morally superior. This is only limited to the degree to which the items are not equivalent (e.g. in price) and the significance of this difference to the individual in question. Since human bad is morally superior to animal bad, we cannot conclude that those who cannot reasonably afford to do so must choose only responsibly sourced options (since doing so would necessarily reduce their quality of life in other areas). We can conclude, however, that for those for whom the additional costs of responsibly sourced products are negligible, there **is** a moral obligation to select these items.

All this said, however, there is no moral obligation to entirely avoid non-vegan products, or even those products that cannot be sourced without animal suffering (e.g. foie-gras).

Curious to hear the thoughts here.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT1:: Addressing a common response that premise B allows for the moral sadist (quote from an answer):

I think an important distinction can be made between torturing animals as a means to enjoyment vs. as an ends. To say that it's morally permissible to torture animals for the sake of human enjoyment is different from saying that it's morally permissible to tolerate animal torture as an undesirable consequence of human enjoyment. Conflating these two points straw mans the argument. I would say that the former is in fact false, leaning on some kind of virtue ethics argument that the qualities of a person deriving pleasure from suffering are a moral bad, or that the act of torturing animals for enjoyment has certain antisocial implications that are morally undesirable.

In the case of mass farming, no one is enjoying the suffering of the animals, so the moral sadist counter-argument doesn't apply.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll try my best to break my argument down into some premises so that it&amp;#39;s easier to follow overall.&lt;/p&gt;

I define gender as the societal implications of being born as a biological male or female. I don't think you can simply change your gender when you feel like it because society will still treat you the same no matter how hard you try to convince people that you are something other than male or female. Trans people want to change how they are treated/ viewed by society due to their sex and therefore their gender.

Because of the fact that men and women are treated differently due to their gender, I don't think gender should exist. I believe that people should have the choice to express themselves freely without being influenced by their sex.

What do you think? Does gender still have value? Should we continue to live in a society with expectations of gender?

Eating animal products is bad, because:

&amp;#x200B;

* It harms the environment. Animal production accounts for a  ~~large majority~~ **edit: large part** of greenhouse gasses emissions, not to mention high costs associated with water consumption and other factors. 
* It contributes to animal abuse. Animals are abused, inseminated, killed under horrible conditions and treated as an object.
* Eating animal products isn't healthier than not eating animal products. While I do not necessarily claim that not eating animal products is healthier per se, it isn't less healthy, \*if the diet is well balanced\*. The argument that vegans need to balance their diet more than non-vegans is not a good argument, because it simply is not true. A typical various vegan diet includes vegetables, legumes, fruits, nuts and seeds. Furthermore, the majority of people (who eat animal products) are also deficient in many micronutrients and over-consume meat to the point it becomes unhealthy anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Arguments I won't accept and why:

&amp;#x200B;

* Convenience: yes, eating animal products can be convenient. However, by doing so, you are essentially placing convenience above suffering of these animals and the environment, which seems like a no-brainer - one wouldn't make the argument for other environmental dangers (e.g. driving a car may be more convenient than taking public transport, that makes it okay), why in this case? Either way, convenience is not a reason to behave in a harmful way under any circumstance. While decreasing meat consumption is a great move, by not limiting it to zero, you are still contributing to the industry.
* Insufficient micro or macro nutrients. The average person is recommended about 10% of calories to come from protein -- basically any vegan diet suceeds in that. It is very easy to complete the amino acid spectrum with just two different plant proteins; however, for example soy is a complete protein with all EAA. As for micronutrients, you can get all minerals and vitamins from plant sources quite easily, or you can supplement (for example the known vitamin B12). The average vegan is also healthier than the average person, but that is a tricky argument, because being vegan usually implies being more aware and careful of your health overall.
* Taste. Same as with convenience - taste is not a good enough reason to cause suffering or harm the environment.
* Bio-meat, grass-fed, etc. - while I accept the fact that under perfect conditions, where your animal products comes from a literal bio farm, one could argue eting that is okay... Any dairy still includes taking away the little calf and taking the cow's milk (in rare cases where it excludes insemination), eggs cause stress for the chicken and thus imply some level of suffering. On top of that, the amount of animal products actually coming from such conditions is incredibly small and definitely does not make its way into a supermarket. Neither does this take away the environmental concern. Furthermore, this is not necessarily an argument against veganism or for omnivorism, as this is not sustainable in the long term anyway.
* Cost. Vegan diet without luxury goods, such as meat replacements or other product replacements (cheese, curd, sausage, etc.), is actually cheaper.
* Any arguments that can be refuted within 5 seconds of googling - evolution, food chain, naturalism, canine teeth, etc.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me preface by saying I am not trying to &amp;quot;convert&amp;quot; people.

I'm soon planning on launching my own business, a risk I would not be able to take if I had to meet significant debt payment obligations in addition to living expenses. My peers with debt don't have this flexibility all because of a decision they made at 18, before experiencing independent adulthood.

When so many people don't even know what they want to do with their lives at 18, why does it make sense for them to take out a loan for tens of thousands of dollars such that it limits what they'll be able to do with the next 10, 15, or 20 years of life?

When people get married it’s especially a vulnerable time in their lives and buying expensive rings just places extra burdens on their finances. 
If you’re a wealthy person and you feel you need to wear expensive pieces of jewelry As a status symbol I completely understand the reasoning. But for those who have to spend 3 months of your salary and potential go into debt or burden yourself financially for a shinny ring- it’s simply a waste of money.

For those with unlimited money nothing is expensive. The exact dollar amount is different for everyone but there is definitely a point where this number is an amount of money that you personally feel the need to use the word “expensive” to describe the item. It’s doesn’t mean you won’t buy it- it just means it places some amount of momentary discomfort or some amount of pressure on you.

As far as I'm concerned, the reason why a fair amount of people are against abortion is because they believe it is an immoral act to kill a living being, but then, why are most of them totally okay with eating a burger in a restaurant? 

Now I understand that a human putting more value in human life over another species life is normal, but I believe that there is no reason to believe that humans are objectively more important than other creatures.

Like, if you're not okay with killing babies, whats your reason for being okay with eating other animals? What value does a human baby have over a piglet or a calf? 
that they can potentially contribute to human society?

 if so, does that mean you are okay with killing humans that can't contribute to human society e.i the mentally/physically disabled? 

Is it okay to kill other animals because we eat them therefore they don't die without a purpose?

 does that mean if we eat the human baby its fine? 




I'm only really asking this because the entire debate between anti abortion vs pro choice seems to be based on morality  and that I can't find any reason to put myself above another animal's enate value over mine. 


I believe if they want to have an abortion, no matter how morbid that act is, they have the right to do so, since we do it to other animals anyways. 

And while this opinion sounds terribly evil in my eyes, I can't find a way to go against this opinion without being somewhat of a hypocrite.

I've been paying a lot of attention to the US 2020 elections, and in particular some of the policies brought forward by the various candidates. Two policies in particular that I think are worth examining in more detail are Bernie Sanders' [federal jobs guarantee](https://berniesanders.com/issues/jobs-for-all/) and Andrew Yang's [UBI](https://yang2020.com/freedom-dividend). I think they are interesting in that they are two solutions to the same problem — runaway capitalism — but I ultimately think that of the two a universal basic income is the superior solution. I have been a fan of UBI for a while now (not sure when I first heard of it, but I liked it since I did), so I admit to some pro UBI bias, and I disliked a job guarantee from the moment I heard of it, so I admit an anti JG bias. In the spirit of epistemic hygiene, I would lay out why I oppose a jobs guarantee, why I think a UBI is counterfactually better (I would be light in my pro UBI section because of length), and what could convince me to change my mind.   
  
Before we begin, I'd like you to take not of the fact that I said ""counterfactually better"". I am not claiming that the status quo is better than a jobs guarantee, but that a universal basic income program is better than a jobs guarantee. To defend a jobs guarantee, it's not sufficient to make the case that warts and all it's superior to the status quo, you must make the case that it's superior to a universal basic income. The world you'd be comparing a jobs guarantee to isn't the status quo but a world with universal basic income.

#Why I Oppose a Federal Jobs Guarantee.  
  
##A Note on Incentives
Before I lay the case for why I am opposed to a jobs guarantee, I would like to talk about my beliefs regarding incentives as they are central to why I oppose job guarantees. A defense of these beliefs would be worth it's own post, so I wouldn't lay out the motivation for these beliefs, and would instead just lay out the beliefs themselves. I do not take these beliefs as axiomatic, so it is not fruitless to argue against them (though I would prefer you didn't do that as the burden of evidence required for me to meaningfully change my mind on this is much higher), but your efforts would be better served attacking the arguments against a job guarantee directly. That said, these are my beliefs:     
  
* Most humans largely have the same preferences: Most of us have the same basic needs: food, shelter, clothing and similar wants: higher status, happiness, happiness for our loved ones, etc. There's variation in specifics (e.g different preferences in types of houses, but we do prefer houses generally).
* Most problems in complex systems involving humans can be explained using incentives. Systematic bad behaviour is often as a result of incentive structures, which incentivise undesirable behaviour amongst members of the system. [It's rarely as a result of personal moral failings of members of the system]().  
* As a corollary to the above, most successes in complex systems involving humans can be explained using incentives. Systematic good behaviour is often as a result of incentive structures, which incentivise desirable behaviour amongst members of the system. [It's rarely as a result of personal moral uprightness of members of the system]().  
* From the above, I conclude that the best way to improve complex human systems is to change the extant incentives rather than to change the people involved (either by replacement or modifying their utility function directly). If your plan requires people to be especially moral to be effective then it's a shite plan. The desired outcome(s) should occur even when the individuals involved have no moral/personality idiosyncrasies, as a result of the incentives in place.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
##The Case Against a Jobs Guarantee  
  
I am not a gainst a jobs guarantee because of the ""jobs"" part, but largely because of the ""guarantee"" part. Assuming that the ""guarantee"" implies that workers can't be fired (excluding extraneous circumstances) and there's strong job security, a jobs guarantee perverts the incentive structures. it decouples employee productivity from employee compensation, and removes any incentive employees have to be productive at their workplace. Without an incentive to be productive, employees would be counterfactually much less productive than they would be under private employment. One could argue that employee productivity is already decoupled from employee compensation, but I would counter that while there isn't a very strong positive correlation between productivity and compensation, the two are largely still correlated. For example, higher productivity may lead to bonuses, promotions, raises, stock options (or rise in company valuation for employees who have stock options), more benefits, etc. On the other hand, lower productivity may lead to no bonuses, less benefits, lowered wages, demotions, getting fired. The private sector generally tracks some measure of employee productivity, and it seems to factor into decision making. They are also incentivised to reward higher productivity (and punish lower productivity) so it's what you would expect.  
  
The above leads to a situation in which the average employee in a jobs guarantee program is less productive than a similarly compensated employee in the private sector. This makes the economy less efficient as a whole, and as each jobs guarantee employee is one less private sector employee there is a reduction in overall productivity. Furthermore, there are allocative inefficiencies, as employees in jobs programs may not be matched to the most appropriate application of their skills (granted this would also occur in the private sector, but a jobs guarantee would exacerbate it) further depressing economic output. 
  
Furthermore, employing several tens of millions of people (a number that would only rise as [accelerating technological advancement displaces](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610005/every-study-we-could-find-on-what-automation-will-do-to-jobs-in-one-chart/) [more and more private sector employees](https://www.axios.com/automation-jobs-replace-united-states-location-8a2f02d4-cfd8-4310-af73-b61c71871938.html)) has massive bureaucracy. A lot of resources would be expended merely administering all the workers. This giant bureaucracy would likely incentivise systematic inefficiency and lead to even more resource waste.  
  
To make matters worse, workers admitted into a jobs guarantee program may find it exceedingly difficult to transition to the private sector (federal employees already find transitioning to the private sector difficult, but a jobs guarantee may make this worse due to skill atrophy as a result of the lowered productivity). This creates a class of workers dependent on the government for sustenance. This would make ending the jobs guarantee program difficult in the future (as it would lead to significant hardship for tens of millions of people) and entrenches the inefficiency. Ultimately, this reduces the jobs guarantee program to workfare (welfare with a work requirement, like the [Victorian workhouses]()). We are left with a ginormous bureaucracy that is woefully inefficient and wastes both the government's resources and workers.  
  
To top it all off, workers in a jobs guarantee program are out of luck if they dislike their assigned jobs. However, as they'e dependent on it, they're unlikely to quit. As the dependent population would only continue to grow as more and more people are displaced from the workforce all the above problems would become progressively worse.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
##The Case For a Jobs Guarantee  
  
The main advantages of a jobs guarantee I see are:  
  
1. Cost: It would be less expensive than a universal basic income program.  
2. Labour: The government gains access to a steady and reliable labour force for various projects like infrastructure development, climate change, etc.  
  
The first is a point in a jobs guarantee's favour (though it would grow faster than a UBI as each displaced private sector worker is one more jobs guarantee worker). As for the second, a normal jobs program without the guarantee part seems superior (all the advantages without many of the disadvantages). As I said before, I am not opposed to jobs programs. Ultimately it seems to me that the only advantage of a jobs guarantee over a universal basic income is cost, and I think the benefits of UBI and the disadvantages of a jobs guarantee tip the scale in UBI's favour.

#Why I Support Universal Basic Income  
  
[There are many](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/why-we-should-all-have-a-basic-income/) [reasons to support](https://www.basicincome.org.uk/reasons-support-basic-income) [universal basic income](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-should-we-support-the_b_7630162) [on its own](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2017/02/15/three-reasons-for-universal-basic-income/), or [as an alternative to a jobs guarantee](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/05/16/basic-income-not-basic-jobs-against-hijacking-utopia/) and I don't really want to rehash here what you can read elsewhere, so I just linked them above, and below I'll formulate the arguments most relevant to me.  
  
The SSC article goes into more detail about this (if you read only one link above, read that one), but a UBI helps many classes of people that a jobs guarantee does not: (disabled, caretakers, parents)
  
In my case against a jobs guarantee, I mentioned that a jobs guarantee would likely lead to a reduction in economic output. UBI does the exact opposite. By putting money directly into the hands of everyone, UBI acts as a massive financial stimulus to the economy. Most of the people who receive UBI would spend a lot of their extra income, and that money would go to others who would also spend some of the money, so the fiscal multiplier would be high. The increased money in circulation would likely result in a significant increase in economic ouftput. A study by the Roosevelt institute on $1,000/mo predicted a permanent 12.5% rise in GDP after 8 years.  
  
Furthermore, UBI is likely to increase productivity not only compared to a jobs guarantee world, but also compared to the current one. UBI gives workers financial independence. No longer dependent on their employers (government and private sector alike) for sustenance they are are free to identify the jobs best suited to their particular skillsets. Milton Friedman said: ""no one spends another's money as wisely as he spends his own"", as a corollary to that I would say: ""no one spends another's labour as wisely as they spend their own"". The financial independence provided by a UBI would drastically reduce the allocative efficiencies that would exist under a jobs guarantee program, and under the current system. This could result in a substantial increase in productivity. This in particular is one of the things that most excites me about a UBI.    
  
Administering a UBI has (relatively) very little bureaucracy involved, and much lower administrative costs. So there would be less wastage of resources (labour, capital, etc) in maintaining a UBI program. Admittedly, the monetary cost due to inefficiency in a jobs guarantee program would be offset by the greater expenses in a UBI program, but a UBI also does more, and the administrative workers maintaining the bureaucracy would be free to do more productive work.

&amp;nbsp;  
  
#How to Change My Mind  
  
I admittedly haven't done much research into jobs guarantees, so I expect that there are things I am wrong on, misunderstanding or whose impact I'm incorrectly estimating. I think it would be easier to shift my mind on a jobs guarantee than on UBI (not as much as for incentives, but I am pretty firmly in the pro UBI camp and the burden of evidence required to change that is pretty high) so I'll focus on that in this section.  
  
I'll be more favourable towards a jobs guarantee if:  
  
* The ""guarantee"" is softer than I believe, and compensation isn't completely decoupled from productivity.  
* There are other incentive structures that I am not aware of in place to maintain productivity.  
* The US government is competent at administering tens of millions of workers, and the bureaucracy involved in administering jobs guarantee workers grows sufficiently sublinearly with the number of workers. The resource wastage is otherwise significantly smaller than I currently believe.  
* A jobs guarantee program has other benefits over a UBI besides being less expensive and providing the government with a reliable source of labour.

The resource wastage is otherwise significantly smaller than I currently believe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A jobs guarantee program has other benefits over a UBI besides being less expensive and providing the government with a reliable source of labour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Those constraints are:

* the ability to adapt to certain environments (we can only program environments that come to mind, if it faces an unknown situation it is helpless, and does not contain the genetic wiring we have to adapt to the situations that arise.
* Programming a machine based off of our finite knowledge and biased ideas will never be able to render something outside of what we can comprehend.

The religious fundamentalists were saying “if gay marriage is okay then what about polygamy or beastiality or pedophilia, etc”

The liberal position against this has solidified as “everything is okay as long as its consenting adults”.

When the traditional, religious based morality was the standard, It used to be that lesbian sex or threesomes was limit pushing, transgressive sexuality. As the new secular liberal morality has become hegemonic, we have seen a rapid shift in what is considered taboo. 

It was thought by liberals that this was sexually liberating, allowing us to have more full, satisfying sex lives.... But is that the case? Are people today finding greater satisfaction in their sex lives? Are people today finding greater satisfaction in their relationships?

From a psychoanalytic perspective, I would argue that sexuality is never normative, but rather is inherently transgressive in nature. Where does this leave us when all kinds of sexuality is considered normal &amp; we have all but abandoned the idea of taboo? 

We are living in an era where every kind of pornography the imagination can conceive of is available at the fingertips of anyone with a smartphone, which is just about everyone who can talk. Culturally this is celebrated as progressive or inclusive. Even the most basic and cross cultural sexual taboos (incest) are now part of hit mainstream entertainment.

It’s clear there is a tendency towards pushing the boundaries, and transgressing the limits of what is considered acceptable, so what is the logical progression of this? The only limits in secular liberal morality is “consenting adults”, so consent and children have been treated as sacrosanct. 

As every kink becomes normalized and mainstreamed, it’s just a matter of time before those last two taboos are seen as transgressive and therefore perversely desired. 

So what are the protections and guards against this? What arguments can be used against it and how might we expect this to come?

The first place may be in fiction. How would we argue against fictional depictions of rape or pedophilia if we only assume a secular liberal  worldview? With increasing technology, what happens if some company thinks there would be a profitable market in ultra realistic CGI VR pornography featuring rape or pedophilia?

Should this be acceptable or legal or normalized?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, one of the most commonly used arguments (and one of the most easily dismissed) against changes to our ideas of normative sexual morality is the “slippery slope argument”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the traditional, religious based morality was the standard, It used to be that lesbian sex or threesomes was limit pushing, transgressive sexuality. As the new secular liberal morality has become hegemonic, we have seen a rapid shift in what is considered taboo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was thought by liberals that this was sexually liberating, allowing us to have more full, satisfying sex lives.... But is that the case? Are people today finding greater satisfaction in their sex lives? Are people today finding greater satisfaction in their relationships?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a psychoanalytic perspective, I would argue that sexuality is never normative, but rather is inherently transgressive in nature. Where does this leave us when all kinds of sexuality is considered normal &amp;amp; we have all but abandoned the idea of taboo? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are living in an era where every kind of pornography the imagination can conceive of is available at the fingertips of anyone with a smartphone, which is just about everyone who can talk. Culturally this is celebrated as progressive or inclusive. Even the most basic and cross cultural sexual taboos (incest) are now part of hit mainstream entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s clear there is a tendency towards pushing the boundaries, and transgressing the limits of what is considered acceptable, so what is the logical progression of this? The only limits in secular liberal morality is “consenting adults”, so consent and children have been treated as sacrosanct. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As every kink becomes normalized and mainstreamed, it’s just a matter of time before those last two taboos are seen as transgressive and therefore perversely desired. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what are the protections and guards against this? What arguments can be used against it and how might we expect this to come?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first place may be in fiction. How would we argue against fictional depictions of rape or pedophilia if we only assume a secular liberal  worldview? With increasing technology, what happens if some company thinks there would be a profitable market in ultra realistic CGI VR pornography featuring rape or pedophilia?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should this be acceptable or legal or normalized?&lt;/p&gt;

""You can rationalize both good and evil but you can't rationalize the irrational."" this is something I am fond of saying because (I believe) it best precisely summarizes my position on morality. I've been discussing/arguing/debating morality recently online and I've been going into these conversations with the aforementioned position. But those conversations have made me at least vaguely aware of a potential misconception on my part concerning morality and/or a frequent misunderstanding on the part of parties to which I am trying to articulate my position, as well as a frequent miscommunication caused by the interchangeability of all or some of the following terms which I've separated into quoted groups: ""ought to, good, moral, correct, right, rational, objective"" \*\*and\*\* ""ought not, evil, immoral, incorrect, wrong, irrational, subjective"". As well as ""values &amp;/or goals, axioms, moral frameworks, justifications.""  Not that I don't understand the difference in denotations and connotations of these terms per se, but rather I often use them as if they're synonymous when perhaps a better term would do.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*I will define the terms I deem necessary to define (at least the way I've been using and understanding them with regard to morality) as I write this post here (and perhaps edit in the rest):\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Morality:\*\* That which we ought and ought not do to achieve some goal or to preserve, or some value.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Moral framework:\*\* A collection of oughts and ought nots derived from axioms for morality that are (to be considered) self evident.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Goal:\*\*  A desired outcome to be achieved.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Subjective:\*\* based on or influenced by personal feelings, tastes, or opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my understanding of the terms listed above, and a more detailed version of my position:

&amp;#x200B;

I am a moral realist, by which I mean I believe that what one ought do and ought not do are derived from one's current values and goals which one themselves may not entirely be aware of and as such one's values and goals are prone to stemming from irrational/ignorant beliefs and/or pathological (that is to say, it is possible for someone to justify some action or belief that contradicts their own stated values and goals. Someone may say they value the freedom of humans, but they may also value keeping their slaves, thus they may experience cognitive dissonance and somehow justify their contradiction by defining their slaves as subhuman,  perhaps whether they genuinely believe it, but especially if they deceive themselves).

&amp;#x200B;

Sort of like chess (an analogy with which I am sure many of you are familiar), the rules are arbitrary but there are objectively moves that bring you closer or further away from achieve the goal of winning the game whether you know what those moves or not, and whether you can even know what those moves or not.

&amp;#x200B;

To minimize acting against our own interests, we construct explicit moral frameworks which increase the scope of our morality such that we can more consistently do what we ought to, and not do we ought not do, across more instances and contexts and to greater degrees.  An implicit moral framework then, would just be one an individual generally attempts to follow, because they fundamentally agree with it, though they may not be entirely aware of it such that they cannot articulate it if asked. Philosophers dismiss frameworks that contradict themselves (and can't be or aren't applied consistently) because they value progress (I should mention, I don't think irrationality is something we ought not do in and of itself, that to depends on our values and goals).

&amp;#x200B;

Any rational actor will do the same things if given the same moral framework. However, there are different moral frameworks with different axioms. That is to say, any rational actor given the same values, same goals, same conditions, same knowledge, same ability would do the same things (as they ought to do them) and not do the same things (as they ought not do them). This can lead to rational actors with \*more or less\* conflicting interests and behaviors and this is what I've been referring to as subjective. Who or what is to say which rational actor opposing another because their values and goals conflict, is good or evil? Is it not fair to call this subjective (see above definition). After all, it is \*personal\* to the individual rational actors, right? It should be fair, in so far as I'm only calling this particular aspect of morality subjective. As far as I can tell, what we call good and evil, just depends on our values and goals, whether we are rational or not.

&amp;#x200B;

To return to the chess analogy, both players (or rational actors) will do what it takes to win. They can't both win (at most a stalemate can be forced, which can be preferred to losing). We can't say it's right or wrong for one to win and not the other, but we can say it is right or wrong relative to the players themselves, who want to win and don't want to lose.

&amp;#x200B;

Would actually appreciate that those who are knowledgeable on philosophy to participate in this thread, however I ask that you be pragmatic and use more easily understood language when and if you can. If you need to use some jargon native to philosophy (etc.), try defining it as you use it. And, I ask people who are asked to define something themselves do so to the best of their ability. If their definition doesn't seem to convey what they mean, try helping them convey it rather than using it as an opportunity to capitalize on a ""gotcha"" or try to get them to articulate a position they don't actually hold. Point out inconsistencies, fallacies, and contradictions sure, but don't get them to articulate something they don't believe just because of their limited vocabulary. Please correct me and others if we use terms incorrectly or imprecisely and perhaps suggest a better one. Of course I ask this for me as well, as I am not formally trained in philosophy, as are many others (expecting us to suddenly be trained in philosophy when engage in this post unpragmatic). I believe this will make any conversations \*much\* more productive.

If someone can give me liberal party policies and tell me why it benefits them, or Australia in general I can more than respect your view. However, in my experience so far most people voted the way they did because of these reasons:  


1. The ""Death/retiree"" Tax: Complete myth. This change to super would not affect 90% of people, it would only affect those with millions upon millions in superannuation. As we know, putting money into your super has certain tax benefits and this policy was mostly to stop those taking advantage, not to steal money from retirees or dead people. 
2. Negative Gearing:  This one is tough because your stance on this will generally be aligned with your personal affairs. But again, really only affecting those with enough negative gearing to have tax breaks. Point of the policy is to make house prices (which are currently ludicrous) in Australia more affordable for younger people. Biggest talking point here in my opinion is that Labor were looking to lower house prices while Liberals were looking to, at the very least, keep them where they are. 
3. Economy destroying climate policies: The liberals had no policies that had anything to do with climate change, while labor had a couple. I'm open to discuss them all however the biggest talking point was probably the energy/renewables policies.  I think one point a majority of Australian's can agree on is that SOMETHING should be done about the environment and climate change. There were stories circulating that the energy policy of labor would somehow destroy the economy and people would lose a large number of jobs. The longer you wait to combat climate change and the environment, the more expensive it will become. 99% of economists will tell you renewable energy is more efficient and cheaper than coal and in my opinion we should really be starting the switch from coal plants now rather than later. On that point however, I talk about the budget surplus below, but if the Liberals truly thought we would be in budget surplus, surely there was some room in the budget for a single climate change policy.
4. Increase in taxes: Another myth. Liberals cut taxes in their budget while Labor kept taxes constant. So all the marketing about the increase in taxes if Labor got in was actually just the difference between Liberals lowering them and Labor keeping them the same. On this point, the liberals in their budget actually moved towards a flatter tax bracket, whereby everyone got a tax cut, however those who benefited most were those earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. (Don't quote me, these are rough rough calculations from a couple of months ago but I think it was people earning around 150k will save 10k on taxes and those earning around 750k will be saving 50k on taxes a year). Regardless if the numbers are accurate, it was somehow construed that labor would be taking money from people and liberals would be giving it back.  
5. The Budget Surplus: The liberals claimed that we were going to be in Budget Surplus, and most people believe just being in a surplus is a good thing. Being in a budget surplus isn't actually the truth, we will not be in a surplus under the liberals - which is my first problem with this. It wasn't technically a lie to say we would be in surplus, however it is a large stretch of the truth and a number of unlikely things would have to happen in order for us to be in a surplus. My second problem is that everyone just assumes a budget surplus is good - it isn't good, nor is it bad. It depends on the economic conditions. I personally believe we aren't in an economic situation where we should be aiming for a surplus, even if we were in a budget surplus. 
6. Scott Morison is more professional than Bill Shorten: While the elected party leader becomes prime minister, their appearance has zero impact on how they run the country or otherwise implement policies. You aren't voting for Scott Morrison or Bill Shorten, you are voting for the policies their respective parties are going to implement. The head of the party has no more pull than your local member of parliament. 

&amp;#x200B;

While I definitely understand that an election campaign is as much about marketing as anything else, a party should not be elected because they undermined the other party better. They should be elected on how well their policies affect you and Australia in general, and in my opinion many people got lost in this. Obvious small sample size but they people I've talked to about this and sometimes taken by surprise when I bring up some of these points.  

&amp;#x200B;

Happy to go into further detail regarding the points I've brought up, or to go into new points someone brings up.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me preface this by saying that I have no political agenda or allegiances, I am not salty about the election result or anything, what angers me most are the reasons people voted the way they did. If someone can give me liberal party policies and tell me why it benefits them, or Australia in general I can more than respect your view. However, in my experience so far most people voted the way they did because of these reasons:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;quot;Death/retiree&amp;quot; Tax: Complete myth. This change to super would not affect 90% of people, it would only affect those with millions upon millions in superannuation. As we know, putting money into your super has certain tax benefits and this policy was mostly to stop those taking advantage, not to steal money from retirees or dead people. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Negative Gearing:  This one is tough because your stance on this will generally be aligned with your personal affairs. But again, really only affecting those with enough negative gearing to have tax breaks. Point of the policy is to make house prices (which are currently ludicrous) in Australia more affordable for younger people. Biggest talking point here in my opinion is that Labor were looking to lower house prices while Liberals were looking to, at the very least, keep them where they are. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economy destroying climate policies: The liberals had no policies that had anything to do with climate change, while labor had a couple. I&amp;#39;m open to discuss them all however the biggest talking point was probably the energy/renewables policies.  I think one point a majority of Australian&amp;#39;s can agree on is that SOMETHING should be done about the environment and climate change. There were stories circulating that the energy policy of labor would somehow destroy the economy and people would lose a large number of jobs. The longer you wait to combat climate change and the environment, the more expensive it will become. 99% of economists will tell you renewable energy is more efficient and cheaper than coal and in my opinion we should really be starting the switch from coal plants now rather than later. On that point however, I talk about the budget surplus below, but if the Liberals truly thought we would be in budget surplus, surely there was some room in the budget for a single climate change policy.&lt;/li&gt;

However, when considering them head to head, I can’t help but side with Breaking Bad. 

Obviously, spoilers ahead (mainly GOT): 

Although this opinion is shared by many, Game of Thrones is generally the more popular show (at least in my circle of friends), and thus there will be several people who do believe that Game of Thrones wins over Breaking Bad. 

Feel free to share your thoughts on why this is the case. 

The main reasons I prefer BrBa to GOT:

First of all, writing. 
Everything in Breaking Bad had a purpose - the composition of each scene often symbolised a later concept in the show - creating several moments of clever foreshadowing. 
Towards the end of Game of Thrones particularly, the writing got lazy. It’s literally become a meme that D&amp;D’s justification for Daeny’s encounter with the Iron Fleet is that she just “kinda forgot about them. ” I don’t think they were equipped to develop the show past what had been set in place by GRRM, and thus the show experienced a severe drop in quality during the last two seasons, particularly in regards to the quality of writing. 
I think undeniably, Breaking Bad wins on writing. 

Second of all, subtlety. 
Game of Thrones is notorious for its unpredictable twists, however imo this isn’t always a good thing, and this is an area where I believe Breaking Bad is superior - the ability to maintain good storytelling without big ‘shock’ moments. It felt at times that when a GOT character arc began to reach a dead end, one of the main characters would be randomly killed off. Sure, this creates that “oh shit” moment, and keeps the audience engaged, but when zooming out and looking at the show in its entirety, Breaking Bad produces far more tangible connections between each of the characters because they are developed further, and hence allows for a much more satisfying “wrapping up” of the show.

An additional example - Breaking Bad’s use of reveals and plot developments to further the story, rather than as a one-off surprise. 
Similar to what I was mentioning before, there were wayyy too many loose ends in GOT when it finished - which the writers literally did nothing with, and just used as cool reveals to make the audience stay tuned for the next episode. The white walkers were a major example of this - they literally didn’t have a purpose. It wasn’t revealed what their intentions were, and rather than a satisfying, logical downfall to the major villain of the story - Arya got the kill. Why? because no-one saw it coming? Pfft
Jon Snow’s heritage - didn’t really have much actual relevance in terms of Jon’s claim to the throne - however merely acted as a reason for Daeny being all angry and mad. 
The Three-eyed raven - Why he’s really significant was never really explored - Bran didn’t do too much in terms of using his powers - bit disappointing. 

Personally, I don’t think acting is an element worth arguing about - both shows had a remarkable cast, and you could make a fair case for either show being superior in this regard. 

In addition, cinematography is fantastic in both shows, however I’d be willing to concede that Game of Thrones wins in this area. 

However, its pretty clear to me that Breaking Bad takes the cake overall - but I may be missing some important considerations - Change my view!

Edit, things I missed:

- The epic scale of Game of Thrones, with massive war scenes, whereas Breaking Bad is primarily character-based, with action being kept to a small scale.
- How ambitious it is, doing something completely new and doing it considerably well, as opposed to 'perfecting' an already common genre of show.
- I guess, although I don't completely agree with it being a reason for a show to be considered 'good' - that Game of Thrones is a lot more 'difficult'.

However, the biggest point for me:
- Game of Thrones focuses on several characters, whereas Breaking Bad only has one main character. Allows for a lot more plot diversity - and a more complex storyline.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by emphasising the fact that I love both of these shows - probably my two favourite of all time.

The way I saw it, Clinton was just going to be 4 years of the same old same old and nothing will get done and that Donald Trump would be at least... interesting. Now 3 years later, I kind of feel like I was duped and I&amp;#39;m pretty ready to vote democrat in the 2020 election. But if it&amp;#39;s not Pete Buttigeige, Bernie Sanders, or Andrew Yang, I certainly will feel crummy at the polls. I just don&amp;#39;t feel like Biden and especially Warren could go up against Trump like those guys could.&lt;/p&gt;

It should first be said that nobody actually enjoys abortion and that people would avoid it if at all possible; however, the reality is people get one to terminate unwanted pregnancies for a multitude of reasons.

As a somewhat conservative Christian, I believe life begins at conception (when the sperm reaches the egg) but am not one for pushing it onto others. It seems many politicians adopt this view as a scapegoat to try and get rid of abortion, but not to actually reduce the need for it. If people cared about abortion, we would be hearing more about efforts to reduce the number of abortions per year and see targeted efforts on that topic (which is what I personally want). In sum, create a society that doesn’t need abortion so that legislation is not needed.

Instead, I see the opposite and am starting to think the politics surrounding abortion have nothing to do with preserving life whatsoever and that the political agenda is instead about something else, but they use the Christian vote to try and make it happen. Here are some examples of things I can come up with to reduce abortion rates and what the politicians are actually doing instead:

Instead of promoting contraceptives to reduce pregnancies (and then obviously reduce abortions), they are removing them from covered medications from employer insurances.

Instead of promoting Plan B or any other emergency contraceptive to help victims of rape or incest, or even just accidents, we are ignoring this altogether and keeping it $50+ OTC making it inaccessible to many victims. I mention Plan B because it is effective prior to conception (takes up to 3 days for sperm to reach the egg and Plan B works before that and does not affect a fertilized egg).

When discussing the idea of preserving life as a fetus, politicians have decided it does not apply to embryos in the lab. They can claim killing a fetus during a pregnancy is murder (take it as a premise, not an argumentative point), but an egg fertilized in a lab can be killed without prejudice even though it is still a living human under their definition.

Overall to boil down my CMV, I think there is an underlying agenda and politicians are unfairly taking advantage of Christians who care about preserving life and reducing a need for abortion that is harmful to our society.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several conflicting views surrounding abortion, primarily with a focus on the religious view on when life begins.

Who would choose to work for $10 an hour when there’s an easy way they could get paid $15 an hour? Those options don’t exist for people caught in poverty. I think having a minimum wage that greater than or equal to a living wage is a moral imperative. 


To me, human labor has inherent value regardless of skill. 40 hours of completely unskilled human labor is still 40 hours of someone’s time and they deserve to be able to afford food and shelter. When slavery was legal, slave owners still gave their slaves food and shelter. Under wage slavery, those things aren’t even necessarily a given. So to me, if your business can’t afford pay a living wage, it shouldn’t be in business. Lots of slave owners were financially screwed after emancipation, but that doesn’t morally justify slavery. So why is it okay for a business owner to say “we can’t afford to pay a living wage.”? 


Then there’s the issue where the government subsidizes the wages of low income employees with EBT and Medicaid. This allows companies to rely on the government to prop their business up while they hoard money and exploit workers. CEOs are essentially siphoning money from the government to pay for new cars and boats and stuff.


Edit: A living wage in no way includes: airpods, yachts, mansions, etc. A living wage just means enough to be able to cover basic needs without government or family assistance. Right now, minimum wage is not at that level. 


Edit: I’m talking about labor that is sold. Of course the labor that comes from scratching your ass or making yourself a sandwich does not have to be compensated. You’re not selling that labor. That is not what “labor” means in this context.


Edit: I understand how free market capitalism works currently. I am advocating for a change.

Alternatively, If Nas and Jay-Z both died during their famous rap feud, they would be elevated similar to Pac and Big. Same could be said for 50 and Ja Rule.

I could go on all day, but my point is that because these artists kept putting out music (some of which has been considered lackluster), they damaged their reputation as the GOAT in a way Tupac and Big never really had a chance to do.

Furthermore, the rap feuds bring in more outside attention from the entertainment world. Thus the layman is able to identify Pac and Big as the GOATs because they are simply the most recognizable/most well known rappers of all time not necessarily the best.

If Mac Miller didn’t make as much frat rap/corny music coming up, he might in the conversation right now. You see the GOAT label unironically placed on XxXtentacion by his fans, although I’m prepared to admit that is a vocal minority.

They'll meet online, enjoy the other person's personality, and decide to start hanging out. That goes well, and they start dating.

I don't think there's anything wrong with picking and choosing aspects of a political view to claim as your own. 

I'll give some examples of my own beliefs (**NOTE: Before this gets derailed, these points are NOT what I want my view changed on, they are just examples of views I take from both sides**):

Left-leaning:

- Pro LGBTQ rights, no explanation needed.

- Abortion should be legal for the sake of the health of the mother and to reduce stress on the social services system.

- Recreational drugs should be legalized, controlled, and taxed.

- Automatic rifles and bump-stocks should not be purchasable by civilians, as no one outside of the military should need firepower that extreme. However this does not extend to semi-automatic rifles.


Right-leaning views:

- Pipelines are the safest and cheapest method of transporting oil and gas and I think more should be built.

- Every adult citizen who is sound of mind should do their best to acquire a firearm **WITH PROPER TRAINING** for the purpose of self-defense.

- While I think immigration is incredibly important to the growth of a nation and it's economy, it should be heavily regulated for the safety of it's citizens.

(Again I'll note that **these views particular views are NOT something I'm wanting or willing to argue about** at this time, I'm just showing opinions from both sides that I believe in for the sake of context.)

I don't see why it's either all or nothing - either you are completely right, completely left, or your opinions aren't strong. Those views I have are very concrete and unlikely to be changed.

I am not ""on the fence"" about joining either side. I don't agree with either side fully, so that will never be the case.

2. More awareness for campaigns for good. Example: Me posting about how I donated blood to the Red Cross brings the Red Cross, their events, and the act of blood donation more awareness.

TL;DR

Reddit allows users to share their opinions anonymously, creating a “safe place” where they can show their uncensored thoughts without a possibility of relevant backlash. This conditions have caused a trend of personal attacks without empathy and respect. The trend will keep growing, as this attacks are being normalized by a community that suffers from a superiority complex. We have disassociated what is acceptable from unacceptable and need rules to draw the line for us. This rules should affect the form of criticism, not the act itself.

   2. A Note

I am a Portuguese 18-years-old and I’m trying to learn better English. If something isn’t understandable, I will try explaining it in another way, so please tell (:

I am well aware that stricter rules to protect people from harassment will never be implemented on Reddit, because many users enjoy it and it has been normalized to the point that it’s too late for the community to see their harm. I also understand that people will always find a platform for personal attacks on the internet. I find this more of a question of principle and I want to know how my opinion is viewed. I am a firm believer that one can only have opinions. We can try to inform ourselves and develop arguments to grow this opinions, but we will never know if we are right. That’s up for others to decide, and that’s why I am here.

&amp;#x200B;

   I will attempt to define the characteristics of the Reddit users that follow this trend and show how they are problematic. I will look for what’s popular and heavily upvoted, as I’m trying to define patterns, and not individual opinions. 

   3. The Superiority Complex

A Superiority Complex is a term used in psychology to define the persistent use of an attitude of superiority, that is motivated by a fear of being inferior, or even a failure. The Reddit users I’m describing like to watch others fail, make mistakes and be punished. There is a mainstream version of this behaviour that has been normalized, as seen in r/Whatcouldgowrong and r/instant_regret. Some hate-subreddits take it further, such as r/TumblrInAction. There are dozens of them following the same structure. Videos, photos and screenshots of ignorant behaviour are shown, that purposefully make the person watching them angry. This hate, that for most people would be unpleasant to experience, is popular and liked amongst the people I’m describing, as watching someone fail gives them the ground to unite and insult/make fun of them in the comments, making them feel superior, something they crave for.

   4. Lack of empathy

The lack of empathy might also be shown in the hate-subreddits I referred to earlier, but there is still a big part of the Reddit community that recognizes them as harassment. The problem lies in another form of harassment, one that has been completely normalized and accepted by everyone. Memes that make fun of celebrities in hurtful ways. Not dozens, not hundreds, thousands of people taking part in joke after joke, year after year, going after someone’s reputation in, again, a need to make themselves feel better, superior. Once someone is caught in the “Reddit meme life-circuit”, they never really escape. They will go back and forth, as the meme disappears and resurfaces all the time. Take the recent James Charles memes as an example. A post on r/dankmemes with 66k upvotes states that a report says James Charles offered to pay straight men to turn gay. This is a joke on an allegation of sexual harassment made about him, which is fake, but it doesn’t matter, because it’s funny. This young guy is being painted as a sexual predator by countless posts, but that doesn’t matter, because it’s funny. Don’t believe me, check the top posts on James Charles this month. This hate happened in several websites, but that doesn’t change the fact that it was popular here in Reddit. People are forgetting that celebrities are people. They might sleep on the most comfortable sheets, and drink the most expensive bottles of vodka, but that doesn’t make them immune to toxicity, and it sure as hell doesn’t make their mental health matter less than anyone’s entertainment. The way Reddit dragged the writers of Game of Thrones is another example of our lack of empathy. Everyone failed to empathise with this 2 writers, who had been contracted to adapt a book, as they messed up the ending of a show everyone liked. Instead, memes and even petitions were made with personal attacks. People were attacking the artist, instead of the art.

   5. My conclusion

The Redditors I’m describing don’t know how to distinguish between acceptable criticism and hurtful, uncalled-for personal attacks. They don’t feel remorse on the way they act and are completely out of touch with the effects of their personal-attacks. They aren’t going to regulate themselves and aren’t going to respect other people, especially celebrities. The only way to protect people from this harassment would therefore be action from the admins and mods of Reddit.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;ol&gt;

Also, I understand that some vegetarians do agree with veganism rather than vegetarianism, but aren't able to be vegan (for whatever reason) and therefore choose vegetarianism as the next best thing - my post isn't about them either. Rather, I'm talking about people who are vegetarians (or believe that they should be) but don't believe that veganism is necessary. Also, I'm pretty sure of the facts that I state here, but my view could of course be changed by me having got some things wrong.

Milk and eggs are both produced by only female animals. For their production, therefore, a majority of female animals is required, with only a small number of males kept for reproduction. Most producers of eggs and dairy kill most male calves/chicks because it doesn't make economic sense to keep them alive. Buying milk and eggs therefore usually depends on killing animals, just like buying meat does.

Obviously, my argument is against people who support buying supermarket/restaurant/etc animal products but not meat. I understand why a vegetarian would buy milk/eggs from a place which keeps both sexes alive, but as far as I'm aware the majority of vegetarians/vegetarian supporters are fine with buying milk/eggs from anywhere. Even free range products usually come from places that kill male calves and chicks.

I know that some vegetarians have their own (female) chickens and eat their eggs. The problem with this is that places that sell chickens also tend to kill male ones, since people are generally interested in buying female ones for eggs. Again, there is clearly no problem with buying female chickens from a place that does not kill males, or breeding them yourself.

Reddit, CMV!

Edit: to be clear, I agree that vegetarianism is better than nothing at all when it comes to stopping animals from being killed. My argument is against the idea that there is no need to be vegan to stop animals from being killed for food, which I have found vegetarians to believe. My argument is NOT that people who don't want animals to be killed have to do everything that is humanly possible to prevent it.

Rather, I&amp;#39;m talking about people who are vegetarians (or believe that they should be) but don&amp;#39;t believe that veganism is necessary. Also, I&amp;#39;m pretty sure of the facts that I state here, but my view could of course be changed by me having got some things wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Milk and eggs are both produced by only female animals. For their production, therefore, a majority of female animals is required, with only a small number of males kept for reproduction. Most producers of eggs and dairy kill most male calves/chicks because it doesn&amp;#39;t make economic sense to keep them alive. Buying milk and eggs therefore usually depends on killing animals, just like buying meat does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, my argument is against people who support buying supermarket/restaurant/etc animal products but not meat. I understand why a vegetarian would buy milk/eggs from a place which keeps both sexes alive, but as far as I&amp;#39;m aware the majority of vegetarians/vegetarian supporters are fine with buying milk/eggs from anywhere. Even free range products usually come from places that kill male calves and chicks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that some vegetarians have their own (female) chickens and eat their eggs. The problem with this is that places that sell chickens also tend to kill male ones, since people are generally interested in buying female ones for eggs. Again, there is clearly no problem with buying female chickens from a place that does not kill males, or breeding them yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reddit, CMV!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: to be clear, I agree that vegetarianism is better than nothing at all when it comes to stopping animals from being killed. My argument is against the idea that there is no need to be vegan to stop animals from being killed for food, which I have found vegetarians to believe. My argument is NOT that people who don&amp;#39;t want animals to be killed have to do everything that is humanly possible to prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;

**RECAP**

Thanks again to everyone who participates in the discussion. I tried to respond to as many people as possible, but at some point the task became too overwhelming.

It was pointed out by several people that I should have titled this post ""Many pro-choice people..."" instead of ""Most pro-choice people..."" While the arguments above are some of the most common ones I hear in the news and on social media, I agree that I could have phrased it better.

From what I have seen, most people disagree with me on bodily autonomy. Maybe it is not very clear from my post, but I 100% agree that a woman has a right to control her body. The issue is that in the case of pregnancy, this right clashes with the right of life of the fetus/baby, so we need to address which one takes precedence. That's why ""my body my choice"" is just as weak as ""we should not kill babies"". We need to discuss person-hood and intrinsic human value in order to have a meaningful discussion.

I also saw a few more arguments which I think are just as bad as 1.-4. One person argued that pro-life positions have positive correlation with low-IQ, so we should automatically be pro-choice. A few other people argued that since women would not want late-term abortions for non-medical reasons, we should not place any restrictions. Lastly, some people argued that since I use words, such as ""infanticide"" and ""child"", I am automatically a pro-life hack and my thread should be removed.

To put things into perspective, I am strongly pro-choice during the first three months of the pregnancy (until the organism develops brain waves). I am strongly against abortion after viability (and pain), unless there are serious health concerns for the baby or the mother. During weeks 12-20, I do not have a particularly strong opinion. The goal of my thread is not to argue in favor of pro-life, but to urge my side to understand better the other side's arguments and to be as genuine and relatable as possible in the conversation.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am personally pro-choice and I think that the heartbeat bills, especially without exclusions for rape and incest, are radical.

So, in my view the big twist of Danny going ""evil"" was well done and amazing. I also believe this is what will happen in the books (probably better written and the details changed, but end result the same). I'm going to preface this by disclaiming that, while I liked season 8, it has it's flaws. Deep flaws. Dudes don't know how to plan a battle for shit. And can't remember about fleets. 

Anyway, so Danny burned Kings Landing. If you remember when Danny took Slavers Bay the slaves actually helped her. They welcomed her as a messiah like character because she broke their chains. She also was ruthless to the Slavers, burning and killing them. Sacking their cities and killing the nobels. We all cheered for her at the time, but that was just a mask for her brutality. The books have it very similar, where Danny utterly destroys those that appose her. Just for the most part those that appose her at first are evil. 

Now Season 6, Danny moves past the books and we no longer have a point of reference to know if this is the same as what GRRM has planned. Season 6 has Danny burn the leaders of the Dothraki because of what they have done. How they treat their wives and send them off when the leader dies. She killed all of them and took over as leader. We cheered because these men were evil, but this is another example of her anger and wrath. 

So she then moves to Westeros and begins her war. She takes Casterly Rock but is out done by Jamie. In response she uses her dragon to burn the army, killing many in a mass slaughter. On top of this she takes her prisoners, and if they don't kneel burns them alive. I believe this scene was supposed to the the ""wait, Danny, you are going to far"" scene. 

Personally, I feel like for the show to be well done we had to believe Danny was good right up until the end. The hints that she might go to such lengths needed to be buried, so that we would not see it coming. Just like the red wedding was a large surprise and we only figured it out in retrospect, so to is how this was supposed to be. 

Danny finally gets to King's Landing, at the start of her journey south it has already cost her one dragon and many of her (respawn capable) Dothraki and Unsullied. She has lost one of her best friends. She has had to endure the north refusing to kneel and treating her with hostility. (Side note I like that Sansa refused to kneel and think it's crazy that the North should trust her even if Danny helped fight the Nights King. The White Walkers were a threat to everyone so Danny was just doing herself a favor). 

So Danny finally heads to King's Landing, having lost so much already and feeling unwanted. The she looses another dragon and her best friend. On top of that her spymaster has betrayed her, Jon is found to be her nephew and has a better claim on the throne, and Jon won't return her affection. She feels alone and rage. The city gives in, but to easily. The people don't want her, and so she finally decides to rule by fear. Make an example of Kings Landing so no one else will ever cross her.

The simple premise is that I believe political parties as formal entities are more trouble than they are worth. I find each representative being ultimately for themselves is better for everyone.  

Small disclaimer - I am not applying this to US specifically but democratic states in general.

1) Representatives become loyal to party first and constituents second. This is not acceptable.    
2) Parties polarize, centralize and effectively stop representing views of people; instead, MP's focus on climbing the party hierarchy.    
3) Parties are inefficient; it is easy to take credit for the party's successes while doing little on your own. In addition, some part can have members that specialize only in a particular type of ideas pertinent to their electorate; agriculture for instance. Parties never end up with ideal candidates for all positions because of the ruling party-opposition dispute for power. After all, better an incompetent candidate from your party than a candidate from the opposition, right?   
4) Parties promote tribalism rather than nuanced thinking &amp; compromise. I contribute partisanship and its obvious flaws to the concept of a formal party.  
5) Individualism, specialization and more unique ideas are squashed under party ""voting discipline"".    
6) All representatives being ultimately for themselves serve to easier get people to get involved behind their candidate and for them to represent their constituents. It is my view each rep could have his own budget for his own office of sorts to make sure each representative is informed and engaged - something that doesn't happen when such flaws can be easily hidden by the party.  
7) All representatives being independent also makes it easier to hold them accountable both on their voting record and their productivity in terms of bills submitted. Each candidate would be responsible for his own PR and marketing, which would activate political dialogue across the board; you no longer get a successfully vote because you belong to a party which coincidentally gets most votes - you get a vote because of what you did or what you propose.  
8) The common counter argument is that individual MP's would argue to get into the spotlight and majority agreement in a crisis would be difficult. To this I counter - do you believe they would do that if they were held accountable for how they act as individuals rather than as a party? *Especially* in a crisis?  
9) Note I do not support delegalizing parties; only make them powerless as formal entities. Ultimately some semblance of parties *would* form anyway but their strength would have much less hold over individual MP's. People would be able to change their mind, vote with their hearts - their own and that of their electorate. Each person would not only be judged by merit, charisma and ability by the electorate but *also* by the MP's themselves as there would be no necessity to cling to the party pick. The party's majority pull would only be as strong as that of the individual MP's rather than preset percentage of seats by the electorate. The electorate is fluid, the parliament ought to be too.  
10) Most importantly, the gap between the opposition and the ruling party would perhaps not disappear overnight, but certainly muddy or even dissipate given time. No longer would opposition members' serve only to undermine the ruling party's efforts while working little themselves; effectively all of the parliament would be engaged. There would be obviously more individual squabbles but it would be far less damaging than the inefficiency that stems from almost half of the people ultimately not taking part in the governing process and the majority having to struggle to maintain or gain more power which leads to erosion of democracy.

I would appreciate your thoughts.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I submitted this discussion point about twice before and hope to mold my view further.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Representatives become loyal to party first and constituents second. This is not acceptable.&lt;br/&gt;
2) Parties polarize, centralize and effectively stop representing views of people; instead, MP&amp;#39;s focus on climbing the party hierarchy.&lt;br/&gt;
3) Parties are inefficient; it is easy to take credit for the party&amp;#39;s successes while doing little on your own. In addition, some part can have members that specialize only in a particular type of ideas pertinent to their electorate; agriculture for instance. Parties never end up with ideal candidates for all positions because of the ruling party-opposition dispute for power. After all, better an incompetent candidate from your party than a candidate from the opposition, right?&lt;br/&gt;
4) Parties promote tribalism rather than nuanced thinking &amp;amp; compromise. I contribute partisanship and its obvious flaws to the concept of a formal party.&lt;br/&gt;
5) Individualism, specialization and more unique ideas are squashed under party &amp;quot;voting discipline&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;
6) All representatives being ultimately for themselves serve to easier get people to get involved behind their candidate and for them to represent their constituents. It is my view each rep could have his own budget for his own office of sorts to make sure each representative is informed and engaged - something that doesn&amp;#39;t happen when such flaws can be easily hidden by the party.&lt;br/&gt;
7) All representatives being independent also makes it easier to hold them accountable both on their voting record and their productivity in terms of bills submitted. Each candidate would be responsible for his own PR and marketing, which would activate political dialogue across the board; you no longer get a successfully vote because you belong to a party which coincidentally gets most votes - you get a vote because of what you did or what you propose.&lt;br/&gt;
8) The common counter argument is that individual MP&amp;#39;s would argue to get into the spotlight and majority agreement in a crisis would be difficult. To this I counter - do you believe they would do that if they were held accountable for how they act as individuals rather than as a party? &lt;em&gt;Especially&lt;/em&gt; in a crisis?&lt;br/&gt;
9) Note I do not support delegalizing parties; only make them powerless as formal entities. Ultimately some semblance of parties &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; form anyway but their strength would have much less hold over individual MP&amp;#39;s. People would be able to change their mind, vote with their hearts - their own and that of their electorate. Each person would not only be judged by merit, charisma and ability by the electorate but &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; by the MP&amp;#39;s themselves as there would be no necessity to cling to the party pick. The party&amp;#39;s majority pull would only be as strong as that of the individual MP&amp;#39;s rather than preset percentage of seats by the electorate. The electorate is fluid, the parliament ought to be too.&lt;br/&gt;
10) Most importantly, the gap between the opposition and the ruling party would perhaps not disappear overnight, but certainly muddy or even dissipate given time. No longer would opposition members&amp;#39; serve only to undermine the ruling party&amp;#39;s efforts while working little themselves; effectively all of the parliament would be engaged. There would be obviously more individual squabbles but it would be far less damaging than the inefficiency that stems from almost half of the people ultimately not taking part in the governing process and the majority having to struggle to maintain or gain more power which leads to erosion of democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would appreciate your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

I think the most obvious distinction between kinds of white people, is that some should really be considered social minorities the same as Latinos, black people Etc, compared to the others who much more truly represent the social majority.

What's a little disturbing is frequently prejudice or discrimination against poor and or rural white people is Justified using the logic that they are all racist in turn against non-whites, and are therefore worthy of contempt. They are also stereotyped as all ""backwards conservative fundamentalist Christian types,"" which of course isn't true at all in many cases, and even so, it's uncalled for just because someone's ideology looks stupid to you (it looks stupid to me as well, but I have to respect people's beliefs).

It's weird. Nowadays you would never (unironically) make a joke about some ultra-stereotypical poor black person,

Anyway, I'm just trying to point out how a lot of the times when people try to be edgy or controversial by directing harsh words towards white people, it seems as if they're usually referring to poor disadvantaged white people, and making that false equivalence that all white people are the recipients of the same level of privilege. It seems really harmful and divisive, with the implication that we necessarily have to treat poor white people worse in order to treat other poor minorities better. In fact it's notable that our political dialogue usually goes this way, with non-white minorities' causes being framed as directly competing with those of white minorities.

The obvious pattern is that by which the Democrats tend to court the poor minority vote while the Republicans Court the poor white vote, either side conceivably could have both if they wanted it, but for some reason neither of them takes the initiative. It doesn't surprise me that the Republicans don't in fact, but it disappoints me that the Democrats don't take this obvious  opportunity to put the Republicans in Checkmate just by changing their rhetoric a little bit, just to make it less race-bait-ey

So overall my point is that just as the term white people is in fact an invented term that arbitrarily links groups of people together, it should be deconstructed show that at the very least, there are two different kinds of white , (in the USA especially but this often applies to other countries) some who constitute the real majority, in terms of wealth and power that is, and those who constitute a minority group all things considered.

first trans women are women born in a man's body afaik so even if the woman has the ""discomfort"" (lets just go with that for now) of living in a man's body she still enjoys the strength she got from being born male and any other benefits it may come from that strength.

however that also means in a sports scenario where the sex matters more than the gender the sex should take precedence since physical ability matters more and thus trans women who have male bodies should compete in men's sport where their physical ability matches with the contestants most of the time unlike in women's sport where their physical ability would mismatch more often

of course most (if not all) of this would be for naught if trans women who have gone through transition have made them to match other women contestants but i have a few issues with that too.

first if we are in a age where we can change people's bodies to suit people's needs then what does that leave us with?

if its good to let trans women who have been weakened enough through transition to compete with women then is it also good to let a man who was born very weak to be able to compete with women?

I concede that:

1) Anakin had still not learned to control his feelings in the way of the Jedi

2) Darth Sidious had his hooks in Anakin and was successfully in the process of brainwashing

3) That had the events concerning Mace Windu and Darth Sidious not taken place, there is still a strong possibility that Darth Sidious may have had the means to finish turning Anakin to the Dark side of the Force.

That said, at that point in the story, Anakin was still very young and impressionable, and uncertain of his future path. If Mace Windu does not throw aside the ideals of the Jedi in that moment and insist on killing Darth Sidious instead of arresting him and bringing him to trial, Anakin does not turn and the opportunity is then presented for 1) Sidious's influence on Anakin to end and 2) the Jedi order to realize the depth of Sidious's corruption of Anakin and correct it.

&lt;p&gt;I concede that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Anakin had still not learned to control his feelings in the way of the Jedi&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Darth Sidious had his hooks in Anakin and was successfully in the process of brainwashing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) That had the events concerning Mace Windu and Darth Sidious not taken place, there is still a strong possibility that Darth Sidious may have had the means to finish turning Anakin to the Dark side of the Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, at that point in the story, Anakin was still very young and impressionable, and uncertain of his future path. If Mace Windu does not throw aside the ideals of the Jedi in that moment and insist on killing Darth Sidious instead of arresting him and bringing him to trial, Anakin does not turn and the opportunity is then presented for 1) Sidious&amp;#39;s influence on Anakin to end and 2) the Jedi order to realize the depth of Sidious&amp;#39;s corruption of Anakin and correct it.&lt;/p&gt;

______________________

You know what's gross?

Pedophilia

Y'all heard about ""MAP""s?

It's just pedophilia trying to sneak their way into the growing acceptance of LGBT people

My gut instinct is, ""that's disgusting and gross,"" and I feel that's very right. However, I found that *some* of their arguments, I couldn't find a logical counter to. I'd like to go through some of these. 

_______________________________

The obvious first case scenario is the one that's also the most easy to refute. Children are not self-aware enough to give sexual consent. Therefore, any sexual acts with them is rape by definition-- ergo, not just illegal, but morally wrong to the highest degree.

______________________

Let's take a second scenario, which I also find pretty disgusting: child pornography. Specifically, photos taken of children in sexual scenarios, that certain individuals would use to sexual arouse or gratify themselves. Again, obviously disgusting, but we need to examine, objectively, the moral harm.

Children are not socially and psychologically aware enough to consent (even if they believe otherwise) to have sexual photos taken of them.

But then, if it is an issue of consent, why is child pornography illegal, but say: leaking photos of your ex without their permission is not illegal? Both are morally wrong, but we tend to think of child pornography as somehow worse, ""Because this person *could* have given consent, then this is more okay."" Child pornography is illegal, but other situations where sexual photos are distributed without the subject's consent are not. Why? How is the possibility of consent, even when it is *very* much not given, somehow better?

____________

If we follow this kind of logic back to our first example: Are sexual acts committed with a minor (where they think they're giving consent) somehow better or worse than sexual acts committed *without* consent against an adult? How does non-consenting sex with a child compare to non-consenting sex with an adult? Are they equally horrific, or is the instance with the child somehow worse? Based on perception, many people seem to think that it is, yet both ultimately come down to an issue of consent not being given, so why does the age of the victim somehow change the level of moral wrongness?

So, compare these four hypotheticals:

A)  Two adults, consensually, have sex with each other.

B)  A child, against their will, is forced to perform sexual acts by an adult.

C)  One adult rapes another.

D)  A child who thinks they are consenting, either through manipulation on the adult's part or because of something twisted in their upbringing, performs sexual acts with an adult.

Obviously, A) is perfectly fine. B) is a felony, and deserves imprisonment (if not lethal injection), C) is also a felony, and deserves imprisonment, and D) is....what? I think the other three (B, C, and D) are equally terrible. But I can't explain *why*. 

D is obviously disgusting, because of the manipulation of a child. But is B somehow any better? A child thinks they give consent, how is that equally bad or even worse than when they are very plainly not giving consent? I don't have a definite answer, so I'm going to move on to the next scenario.

_____________________________________

Fictional characters, children, depicted in sexual scenarios or acts. Still gross? Most definitely. Still illegal? Oh yeah. But why?

Characters are by definition, intellectual property. They have no consent, no will of their own, beyond what the writer chooses to have them do. So, if a writer chooses to create an original character, who is extremely underage, and has them perform sexual acts, either ""consensually"" or otherwise, this person has undoubtedly committed a legal crime, made my stomach churn and forever lost me as a potential reader. But *how* has he committed an inherently immoral act? The child could never have given consent, the adult could not have given consent, neither of them is real, or has any independent intelligence.

I believe there are life long traumas associated with actual sexual acts with actual children. I believe that lesser, but still present trauma in children who are dressed up, and pictures are distributed of them. There is evidence to prove that objectively, people who suffered these acts, even if they thought they were consenting at the time, are deeply scarred by the past actions of other people on them. I *personally* believe, that the viewing of child pornography damages the person who views it, psychologically. But, for a time, I also believed that true of *all* pornography, all sexual media material.

But I don't know how to prove it. How could you possibly test, in an ethical way, the effects of child pornography, on the children in it, the distributors of it, and the consumers of it? If such studies exist, please direct me to them, I haven't been able to find them in my admittedly limited searching.

There is one possible argument to be made: sexual depictions of children, either real life or fictitious, will lead to an increase in the first discussed behavior: actual sexual acts with children. But, that somewhat strikes me as ""thought crime."" Should we lock up mystery writers for describing murder, because of the possibility that it will increase murder? Should people who write rape fantasies be arrested and imprisoned for rape?

I find the second case disgusting, but I wouldn't argue that they should be imprisoned. But I would feel strongly that people who write/draw/distribute child pornography should be imprisoned, and undergo mentally counselling, by force if necessary. But I can't argue *why.*

_______________________

And then, we come to the scenario that I am the least sure of:

Statutory rape in cases of close ages.

* Obviously, an 11 year old with a 30 year old is morally wrong.

* Obviously, an 11 year old with a 19 year old is morally wrong.

* Obviously, a 16 year old with a 30 year old is morally wrong.

* But...is a 16 year old with an 19 year old morally wrong?

Is it equally wrong as all of those other scenarios? It is illegal depending on jurisdiction, but some places view it as ""less damaging""? Why? 

The 16 and 19 year old's are close in ages, and depending on which theory you attest to, similar in terms of intellectual development. But, the 19 year old has committed a crime, because his partner was on the other side of a barrier based on the number of trips around the sun. 

Okay, if we have the age difference as a 'meter' for how immoral the act is, is the 19 + 11 yr old somehow less immoral than the 30 yr old and the 16 yr old? My instinct says no, but it's not like in their instance, the partners are closer to being developed, so why is one more wrong than the other, if one *is* more right/wrong? 

_______________________________

I find all of the acts I've described above to being astonishingly disgusting, and just because I can't find a concrete harm to what's being done, doesn't mean I'd allow it to happen. You bet your ass I'd keep my siblings and cousins away from any creep who admitted to licking loli hentai. But I'm trying to think of this from a perspective of, ""If I was arguing with a 'MAP', and was trying to logically justify each and every one of these condemnations, how would I do it?

I feel it's important to justify my beliefs to myself, to question and challenge them, and if they are not logical, to re-consider them. I don't want to settle for ""I've always felt this way,"" because I feel that leads to people becoming stagnant, or even perpetuating harmful beliefs based on paranoia and defensive confirmation bias. 

The logic of ""it's wrong because society says it's wrong,"" is good enough for me, but for the sake of convincing someone who's *in* that mindset? I want to find better, if it exists. It's even likely that a person trapped in the MAP ""movement,"" would never listen to any other logic; they're like antivaxxers, clinging to paranoia rather than any actual logic because they are attempting to justify and excuse a sick impulse that they've unfortunately experienced, when what they should do is seek mental treatment. 

**TL;DR - When I think about a lot of arguments against pedophilia, I find that the logic doesn't hold up very well when you apply it to similar scenarios. And that kind of unsettles me.**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR - When I think about a lot of arguments against pedophilia, I find that the logic doesn&amp;#39;t hold up very well when you apply it to similar scenarios.

* There's a lot of experience that other people receive by just connecting with someone who has more experience than they do.
* Even when you hang out with people during lunch, you get to hear people sharing work-related stuff. There is a lot of improvement that comes into you by just listening to their experiences.
* You form opinions, you know what works and what doesn't work for various situations.
* In future if you come across a particular misery in office you would know that you're not alone in this because you've already heard of other people's miseries.
* There's still a lot more.

**The part which is not fair / Junior receiving experience:**

* I hear my family member sharing my office experiences / the reasoning behind my life's  decisions / what life decisions I'm taking with her own junior nephew who's just starting out in the corporate industry.
* I believe that it makes no sense for me to share my own experience with any junior. I didn't receive the experience sharing for 15 years. Why should he receive my experience?
* If he were to ask me for help then I'd be glad to share my experiences with him. However, that is not the case.
* He's just casually talking to my family member and receiving so much of experience. Not only my work experience but also some of the life decisions that I've taken and my reasoning behind it.

&amp;#x200B;

I never received help this way. I just feel that this is not fair at all. If life made me suffer relentlessly and I paid a very high price for something then it is not fair for my family member to share my experience with some junior who hasn't suffered the way I have. Change my view.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growing up without a father. Without a family friend. Without an uncle. Literally with zero adults.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking every decision by figuring out rather being taught.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Living 30+ years of life being surrounded by people constantly making fun of me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have 11 years of work experience in the software industry. To this day I have totally had 3 people in my life who would share their office experience with me (none of them were seniors).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effort that I&amp;#39;ve put to form connections:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volunteering at corporate events to connect with people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organizing CSR events in my company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being in my corporate Toastmasters club / being even a club officer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organizing meetups (single-handedly)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joining various classes/workshops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And a whole bunch of other hobbies that involves putting myself out there&lt;/li&gt;

I just think the argument of “my body my choice” is not a well reasoned one. Specifically, we never use that argument in other areas (for the most part) because we intrinsically know it’s bad. 

Take, for instance, hard drugs like meth. While I’m sure some small group says this, there are certainly not millions of people advocating for the legalization of meth under the mantra of “my body my choice” because we understand that just because something only effects your body and your health doesn’t mean you have a right to do it. 

Now, of course the counterargument is that taking hard drugs harms more than just the user, hence it’s illegal while things like assisted suicide are more borderline. Firstly, this ignores the fact that such things are very morally grey. We as a society agree that the issue isn’t so black and white as “my body my choice” when it comes to taking your own life. It’s disingenuous to pretend the abortion argument is black and white.  

Secondly, the issue with that line of thinking is that opponents see unborn fetuses and clumps of cells as people and thus, to them, abortion does harm more than just the one person. To convince them otherwise requires a debate about personhood and the values we assign to different people or things, both of which the “my body my choice” argument do not properly address.

We live in a world where people are openly communist here and feel safe saying so in public and nothing happens to them, but show a spark of nationalistic pride and you lose your job.

I feel like communism (both economic and cultural) are destroying our national phyche.  I just got downvoted to hell elsewhere for daring to question if the Left in america has America's best interests at heart, as I pointed out that if they had our best interest at heart, why would they advocate bringing refugees and asylum seekers here? I've asked many of them why they believe such policies are what are best for America, and they never have a reason for me - their responses are full of foreigner-loving altruism. (Sometimes they'll mention economic benefits, but of course we could achieve that by hand-selecting what immigrants we take in based on an appraisal of their worth to us - not based on how oppressed they are elsewhere. That's the point I was making).

Let's take Le Pen in France for instance. They call this woman ""Far-right"" over there? She's a freaking socialist! (A communist ideology. I don't want to hear about the differences - in the words of Marty Robbins - ""Communism, Socialism, call it what you like. There's very little difference in the two."")  But what, she doesn't want totally open borders? Wants France to have some semblance of its national identity? Isn't a big fan of Islam? And that makes this far-left socialist a ""Far Right"" figure as far as the media and all of Europe is concerned?

We can witness the rise of cultural Marxism in so many ways - the way Veganism has taken off among our misguided youth (once you get someone to hate their own nation and race and feel guilt about all the great things their forefathers have accomplished, it's a small step to get them to feel guilty for the superiority of the human race as well. Gotta check that ""human privilege"" I guess. Disgusting)

We can witness it in the gender and class warfare going on in this country. People hating those who are successful, and thinking they're owed free stuff and that the government should be the ones giving it to them. I recently played through a ""Could you help lead the EU"" interactive game on a news website, and it was one of the most disgusting things I've witnessed recently. It gave me a choice of two people to appoint for a role, I picked one, and it said ""omg that's a lot of men running things, don't we need some women?"" When I clicked an option to put my own nation's interest first at the expense of others, it said ""woah, slow down there, you're not Xi Jinping"" People are being systematically conditioned to hate their own nation, race, and even species. 

It's become commonplace on reddit and elsewhere for people to not even believe in Free Speech anymore (Free Speech with exceptions is not Free Speech. If you can't say unequivocally that a Nazi has an inalienable, absolute, undeniable right to demonstrate and speak his mind freely without fear for his personal safety or government persecution, you don't believe in Free Speech. There's no halfway - you believe in it or you don't.).  I've worked with people from foreign lands in my job, and all of them believe Free Speech is ""overrated."" We are literally importing anti-American viewpoints here, letting them vote, and destroying our national identity. The immigrants I've known don't love this country. They've come to this country as a means to an end, resent us for what we've ""done"" to their crappy homeland, and by and large support anti-American ideologies. They think our freedoms are ""overrated."" Why the hell are we letting these people in?

I think the only way out is to fight against all forms of communism with all of our might. Admitting to supporting socialism, communism, feminism...being the type of person who calls things ""racist"" or ""mysogynistic"" unironically...these people should be treated the way we currently treat the ""far right"" (many of whom, like Le Pen, aren't even far right or right at all...the horrifically shifted Overton window merely makes them appear so). That's what should make people fear losing their jobs and being ""outed"" in the media. Not wanting what's best for your country and your people.

I'm open to change my mind about these things. I try to debate these things at every opportunity on reddit, and almost without exception my opponents resort to name-calling. Ask them what good it is to bring refugees here and to tolerate people who don't speak English, and they won't answer - just call me a Nazi.

The environmentalist party „die Gruenen“ are getting a lot of votes especially in younger demographics (which I am a part of).  Environmentalism is a complex topic involving sustainability, pollution and a lot of other important topics. However this CMV is focused on the global aspect of climate change and co2 emissions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ICCP report on climate change gives humanity the deadline of 2050 to reduce co2 emissions to (close to) 0. This requires global cooperation and participation. If every country was as developed as Germany it might be possible to find that solution as economic growth does not need to be the top priority of policy makers in already highly developed nations. However most people live in countries who need to reach a more developed state first. Industrializing places like China, India and Iran have limited interest in sacrificing regional economic growth and even *if* they agreed to keep their development more sustainable it would not be enough since there are so many countries who try and need to develop more.  If we estimate the number of people in completely developed countries at about 1.5 billion still have between 6 and 10 billion people (depending on population growth) trying to catch up. Even if **only** 3 billion people succeed in that project the effects on global co2 emissions would be catastrophic. Even if we archived a efficiency of ½ co2 per $ produced it (which seems unlikely already) we still need to content with 3 times the population producing and consuming a lot of stuff.  As long as other countries want to industrialize in the next 100 years even reaching 1990 levels in co2 emissions is unrealistic and I want to remind everyone that reaching 1990 levels in co2 emissions is not nearly enough to stop climate change. 

Another factor is that reducing current co2 emissions from 70% 1990 co2 level to 50% co2 level is  harder than reducing co2 emissions from 1990 level to 70% level. Countries reach a point of diminishing returns depending on a couple of factors. 

Germany is not particularly suitable for many renewable energies. Our coastline is not as long as Denmarks. We don't have that much hydro-electric power. Germany isn't that sunny. We already have a share of around 30% renewable energies which is reflected in the energy prices in Germany. 

If you want to make a argument for „helping other nations“ limiting co2 at home is also not the right approach either. German power plants are already pretty efficient compared to stuff that is operating in other places. Modernizing and improving China's or India's power plants does much more good for the global climate than reducing the 2% Germany contributes to co2 emissions to 1,5 or 1% (which will happen anyway since other nations start contributing more).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In conclusion I don't want my country to invest much more into limiting co2 emission. Ironing out some inefficiencies is good but no matter what we do we will not be able to stop climate change. Instead of fighting against the inevitable we should invest our resources into limiting the effects climate change will have. Extreme heat or extreme cold are much more manageable if you are prepared for it. The UAE don't really care about 40°C and Russia isn't scared of a cold winter because those nations are prepared. The Netherlands can fight rising see levels because they prepared themselves. Extreme rainfall and drought is manageable if you have the right countermeasures in place. Climate change is most fundamentally a problem of allocation of resources and allocating resources to less local co2 emissions is not the way to go.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Germany the main point of current political discussion is climate change.

As if just having nuclear weapons is not a threat. Alright, it's of course different if a country just has weapons compared to if they say they're going to use one. But if my neighbour walks on his yard with a gun (and he has used the gun in the past), should I be blamed if I buy a gun for myself?

Same logic applies, or well, applied with Russia's defence strategy. The United States was FAR more aggressive with their firepower than Russia for decades, yet Russia has always been blamed for being the aggressor. Even though I'm Finnish and we've had our problems with Russia, I can't oversee the hypocrisy. US spends somewhat 10 times more money on their military than Russia and has far more bases overseas. This symphaty changed after Russia invaded Crimea, mainly because that changed Finland's geopolitic situation and I'm biased on anything conserning Finland.

Why are some nations entitled to do build weapons of mass destruction while some aren't? Are we delegating the possible destiny of humankind to people like Vladimir Putin, or Donald Trump?

Why aren't the nuclear power countries slowly and safely denuclearizing themselves? Then they could demand the same from everyone else.

The College Board is trying to make the process more equitable with an ""adversity score"" that will be used to quantify the level of disadvantage an applicant faces when taking the SAT. 


The problem with the adversity score is that no one really knows in detail how it's calculated (https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/sat-adversity-score-college-board-algorithm-transparency.html). Presumably it takes into account some factors pertaining to the student's neighborhood and high school. 


With that said there are a few premises I'd like to lay out:
1) If there is a quantitative metric that can influence a college admissions decision, people will try to optimize it
2) The College Board has not disclosed how the adversity score is actually calculated 
3) When information is difficult to obtain, information asymmetries across class lines are more pronounced 


Ultimately, this means that people with more resources will have more information about how to optimize their adversity score. College advising firms will run analytics or consult with their College Board connections to discern what factors go into the score, and then try their best to keep that information proprietary. Ultra-wealthy parents will then be able to exploit the information which they paid the consultant for. For example, it's easy to imagine renting or purchasing a second property in a specific poor neighborhood and then making that a primary mailing address in order to improve the adversity score. 


One might argue that making public what goes into the adversity score would make this information even easier to exploit by those with means. But at least it will give colleges more insight into what the score actually ""means."" Without the appropriate context, admissions officers will only have a vague idea that a higher adversity score = more adversity, and a lot of nuance is lost. Hopefully, it will be easier to tell if people are simply gaming the system if the rules themselves are transparent.

There has been much battle over who can use which spaces etc. and I think this is to do with this massive amount of confusion. I have done a lot of research in the past trying to figure out the reasons and so I came to the distinctions between transgender and transsexual. a transgender person is someone whose gender doesn't align with their assigned sex/gender. a transsexual person is someone who is undergoing a medical process to change the sex of their body. I think this is important.

A lot of the fears surrounding bathroom use and changing rooms etc. seems to revolve around this issue. what a person's body is. not only their shape, but their hormone balance. I know from experience that testosterone can have a powerful effect on behaviour. even at the beginning of my medical transition, I would not use a female restroom, I would use the only neutral one available (the disabled) . This is because I did not trust A certain part of my body that seemed out of my control. I am not suggesting everyone is the same, but there is a very good chance a lot of people will be the same. This is why people are worried. I think it's only natural to be scared. I myself would be scared if I saw someone in the same restroom as me that looked and behaved like arnold schwarzenegger.

Clearly this is very tough and the ideal solution would be to have restrooms, changing rooms etc, that are non binary. but the way things currently are, I think it would be helpful to make this distinction. I think any person who is undergoing medical intervention with regards to their sex, should automatically be given the benefit of the doubt. in the uk, there is the gender recognition certificate. I have a birth certificate that I could easily show to somebody who doubted me. I think this protection is important for cis women, and transsexual women. for transgender women, I think there should also be a pathway to these protections. let's not pretend that there aren't people who simply want to be treated like a woman but are very much in male bodies. this is not to say there are malicious reasons behind this. there may not be in most cases, but we have to be realistic. There is a basis in people's fears. I think that if somebody says that they are not going to medically transition because they don't want to, because they feel comfortable with their anatomy and hormones, then that person should use a restroom suited to their body, or a neutral one. I think we should certainly react to them as they wish to be addressed, but when it comes to safe spaces, we need to look at the bigger picture.

I know people will be pissed at some things I have said here, I am sorry and I don't mean to upset anyone but as long as we all stay quiet, nothing is going to change and ALL trans people are continuing to be mistreated. if we can looks at this from a pragmatic position and start to work towards the opposition and try and meet them halfway, then I think it may be better for all.

I was the affirmation, essentially saying that there should be. My partner and I’s reasoning was (very, very, simply)

1. It has proven effective in trial runs and has proven benefits (for example, Kalamazoo, Michigan)
2. It (in practice) has improved graduation rates and IQ levels
3. It reduces the debt of young adults by as much as 50%.
4. It could be done without raising taxes, and thus would be logical to do. (by doing things such as closing corporate loopholes, or fixing the problem of mismanaged money in the government). [If we implemented things like this](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc1/NegativeIncomeTax.html), then the free college could \*easily\* be funded.

We won the debate, but it left me with this question: Should public college in America be free? Why or why not?

&amp;#x200B;

An explanation of our reasoning:

&amp;#x200B;

1. These aren't ""theoretical"" benefits. I highly encourage you to google the [Kalamazoo Promise](http://research.upjohn.org/up_press/1/), which is a (very small scale) example of a system similar to a ""free college"" system. It has worked wonderfully. [More people](http://research.upjohn.org/up_workingpapers/229/) are enrolling in school and more people are going to college, and more people are graduating. If this merits of this debate were Net Benefit, then it certainly wins out here. Everyone benefits. More people getting education meaning more people eligible for more types of jobs (see point 4 about saturation of Job Market, etc).
2. This also translated in other examples in to higher IQ levels. In a study conducted by Stuart J. Ritchie, (which can be found [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797618774253?journalCode=pssa&amp;)), it was proven that college has a correlation to higher IQ. This finding has been cross referenced to explain the higher IQ's of certain European countries (like Germany or Sweden) that happen to have some form of free college. Their higher IQ scores were attributed to more people going to school (due to the free costs).
3. There is no doubt that it would lower debt. Let's look at it practically: The average American college student graduates with around $37,172 in [debt](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/15/heres-how-much-the-average-student-loan-borrower-owes-when-they-graduate.html). By comparison, the average swede graduates with around $19,000 in [debt](https://qz.com/85017/college-in-sweden-is-free-but-students-still-have-a-ton-of-debt-how-can-that-be/). While this is still high, it is significantly smaller. This is 100% because college is totally free. The correlation can be shown when you look at what this debt is in. For the swedes, it's in things such as expensive housing, etc. The Americans is almost totally in student debt (usually around $24,000 dollars in student loan debt alone).
4. Some say that I actually am waving my hand and saying ""corporate loopholes"" or ""mismanagement of money"" are causing loss of money. However, that is quite literally what happens. [read this](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2018-taxes-some-of-americas-biggest-companies-paid-little-to-no-federal-income-tax-last-year/). Or read [this](https://itep.org/60-fortune-500-companies-avoided-all-federal-income-tax-in-2018-under-new-tax-law/) (which comes directly from the source). It's scary and sad. A lot of money has been lost by this alone. If we \*literally\* closed corporate loopholes that allow these Fortune 500 companies to get away with paying no taxes, we would have \*more\* than enough money to revamp the system and provide free college alone. [here](https://www.cheatsheet.com/money-career/the-most-expensive-mistakes-youre-making-in-your-home.html/) are some ridiculous examples of how our government \*literally\* mismanages money (by mismanage I mean spending it on unnecessary things). That would save a lot of money too. It would take around [$70 billion](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/collegeforallsummary/?inline=file) according to Senator Bernie Sanders to implement college for all. That sounds like a lot, but we already have almost that much if we closed corporate ""loopholes"" and fixed ""mismanaged money"". ([we could save almost $1 billion dollars alone in responsible paper printing alone](https://www.forbes.com/pictures/ejde45i/in-pictures-15-silliest-uses-of-taxpayer-money/#1c86c8a2374f)). If we used all of this mismanaged money on the federal level, and then combined that with mishandled money on the state level, it is estimated we would have around $80 billion dollars, which is more than enough to implement this system \*without\* raising taxes. If America implemented a negative income tax, we would have even more money. For this argument, let's just focus on not increasing taxes though.

&amp;#x200B;

Sub-point (not our main argument): [it used to be free](https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/feb/09/bernie-s/was-college-once-free-united-states-and-it-oversea/).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, what are the impacts of this? Why does it matter?

1. Smarter people, higher level jobs, more money being made and more money being pumped into the economy.
2. More chance for growth of the individual person. This essentially means that each person will have a higher chance of personal gain and growth, essentially a greater chance at the ""American Dream"".
3. More jobs because more people with degrees. There is a common argument stating that supply and demand would make more people with degrees unnecessary. This has been [proven](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/microeconomics/supply-demand-equilibrium/market-equilibrium-tutorial/a/market-equilibrium) to be very situational. When talking about money and goods and services, this is true. However, when talking about those with an education, the ""market"" for high level jobs wouldn't be saturated: rather, there would just be an expansion of these areas (meaning more jobs available because more businesses would open, etc). [The BLS](https://www.bls.gov/home.htm) has several great studies and stats showing the expansion of job markets when more capable people are introduced to the market.
4. This will improve the general quality of life of all Americans.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The criteria for the debate was ""Net Benefit"", meaning the side that provides the most benefit to the general public. How would free education not provide as much benefit as paid education?

&lt;li&gt;More jobs because more people with degrees. There is a common argument stating that supply and demand would make more people with degrees unnecessary. This has been &lt;a href=""https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/microeconomics/supply-demand-equilibrium/market-equilibrium-tutorial/a/market-equilibrium""&gt;proven&lt;/a&gt; to be very situational. When talking about money and goods and services, this is true. However, when talking about those with an education, the &amp;quot;market&amp;quot; for high level jobs wouldn&amp;#39;t be saturated: rather, there would just be an expansion of these areas (meaning more jobs available because more businesses would open, etc). &lt;a href=""https://www.bls.gov/home.htm""&gt;The BLS&lt;/a&gt; has several great studies and stats showing the expansion of job markets when more capable people are introduced to the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This will improve the general quality of life of all Americans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The criteria for the debate was &amp;quot;Net Benefit&amp;quot;, meaning the side that provides the most benefit to the general public. How would free education not provide as much benefit as paid education?&lt;/p&gt;

Morality is a social construct dependant on the community of which acts of moral character are judged. This post is dependant on the definition of morality, and while the definition above may be incomplete and subject to debate, the definition of morality itself does not matter so long as the definition allows for both

1. the moral character of some arbitrary thing or action, collective or otherwise individual in context, to be interpreted by an arbitrary obverser
2. morality to be subject to interpretation; i.e. that there does not exist a true universal set of moral truths

Both of these conditions can be disputed, just not realistically. If a case is made against the first premise, than the second premise must follow to be true.

The problem with that argument is that it completely overlooks what is quite obviously the key issue with abortion: it involves the direct killing of a living fetus. Forced vasectomies violate bodily autonomy just like forced births (as in, illegal abortions), but they don't have the component of killing a fetus which is the heart of the debate. It's completely ignoring the reason pro-lifers are against abortion. They don't want bodily autonomy violated just for the sake of violating bodily autonomy. It's to protect the life of the fetus.

Now, you can make arguments about why killing the fetus is okay (it's not fully developed, not viable, bodily autonomy as a principle overrides the life of the fetus, the eventual outcome of its life would be negative, etc.) but just comparing it to forced vasectomies and thinking you did something clever makes you a moron.

And it's not just that particular comparison that annoys me (though it's especially bad). Pretty much every pro-choice argument ignores the element of the fetus, and every pro-life argument ignores everything else. When you make an argument you gotta address the points of the other side.

Before I describe the experiment, here are some assumptions. I'm treating these as given, but will entertain arguments why they shouldn't be.

**Assumptions:**

* The naturalistic fallacy is in fact a fallacy.

*ex. Occurring naturally has no bearing on whether something is good or not, while granting that natural often serves as a useful proxy for good.*

* Well-being only applies to things that can experience suffering.

*ex. A rock cannot suffer and therefore has no concerns for well-being. The removal of that rock could cause suffering to conscious creatures, and therefore its removal has ethical implications, but not directed toward the rock itself.*

**Thought Experiment:**

Imagine a machine that, somehow, is capable of perfectly fertilizing and incubating a human egg. It never fails, and the embryo will always grow into a healthy human child. I can press a button, the egg is fertilized, the machine does the rest.

*Scenario 1:* I press the button, the egg is fertilized. Some time later, before the embryo develops enough that it is capable of subjective experience, I destroy the fertilized egg.

*Scenario 2:* I press the button, but just as the egg is about to be fertilized, I stop the machine. The egg and sperm are destroyed.

*Scenario 3:* I have the option to press the button, but decide not to. I do nothing, and the egg and sperm are destroyed.

**Argument:** 

Taken at face value, without introducing unnecessary confounding factors (for example, the possible wastefulness of destroying the egg and sperm), I contend that these 3 scenarios are equal ethically speaking.

The only difference between these 3 scenarios is whether the egg would naturally grow into a human or not, but the keyword there is *naturally*. Interrupting the development of the embryo and interrupting my pressing the button are identical in that they all disrupt a potential human life from forming. The reductio ad absurdem of that is *every* potential human life that isn't allowed to exist is equal to aborting a growing embryo, which would mean any time you're failing to procreate, or any time some bio lab isn't cloning as many humans as it possibly can, it is ethically the same as abortion.

This position breaks down when the unborn baby is capable of subjective experience, and the more keenly it is able to experience things, the muddier the water gets.

I slept soundly, thanks to the lack of interruption due to predators or pests. When I awoke, I walked over a cushioned and carpeted path into a room designed for my personal cleanliness, before washing myself in the luxury of temperature-controlled water with various soaps and liquids specifically engineered for caring for my skin.  


After this, I dried myself with a fluffed cotton towel, before pulling clean, colorful clothing from a $1500 dresser set. I retrieved my state-of-the-art cellular device, before reviewing the variety of communications waiting for me from friends and loved ones, along with educating myself on daily news events with the swipe of a finger.  


I then pressed a button to produce a brewed coffee more delicious than any trading post would have dreamed of 100 years ago, while adding gourmet Hazelnut flavoring. I fed my pleasant fur companions, all of which who were happy and in good health. I hopped into the cushioned seat of my car, which is worth several thousand dollars, selected the exact artist and song from the last 50 years that I wished to listen to, and then moved 3 times faster in my car than what would be biologically possible, all while breathing in air at the exact temperature I find comfortable.  


After this short journey, I arrived at a temperature-controlled building, greeted with a task that if completed correctly, would grant me more 13x the pay that an average Sub-Saharan African would make in the same day. While doing so, I once again selected the exact musical artist from a selection of millions that would suit my tastes for the day. At no point was I concerned with hunger, sickness, predators, violence, or any other of the standard unpleasantness that have been faced daily by 99% of all mammals that have ever existed.

And yet, throughout this process, I grumbled over my alarm, grumbled over work, grumbled over my budget, grumbled over what others had that I did not, etc etc.  


When comparing my life to someone in the same country, at a similar social class, 200 years ago, my life is incredible and filled with conveniences and luxuries that they couldn't even dream of. And even those people in the 1800's were living lives that were free of most of the burdens that other living things face daily. So why hasn't the modern American had an increase in happiness that correlates with the increase in improved quality of life over the last 300 years?  


Tl;dr My cushy modern western life is amazing and its stupid that I'm not in a state of euphoria 90% of the time.

Edit: I'm going with french vanilla this morning while reading responses","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, I awoke in a temperature-controlled room, shared with my life&amp;#39;s partner, on a piece of furniture specifically engineered for comfort while sleeping. I slept soundly, thanks to the lack of interruption due to predators or pests. When I awoke, I walked over a cushioned and carpeted path into a room designed for my personal cleanliness, before washing myself in the luxury of temperature-controlled water with various soaps and liquids specifically engineered for caring for my skin.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this, I dried myself with a fluffed cotton towel, before pulling clean, colorful clothing from a $1500 dresser set. I retrieved my state-of-the-art cellular device, before reviewing the variety of communications waiting for me from friends and loved ones, along with educating myself on daily news events with the swipe of a finger.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then pressed a button to produce a brewed coffee more delicious than any trading post would have dreamed of 100 years ago, while adding gourmet Hazelnut flavoring. I fed my pleasant fur companions, all of which who were happy and in good health. I hopped into the cushioned seat of my car, which is worth several thousand dollars, selected the exact artist and song from the last 50 years that I wished to listen to, and then moved 3 times faster in my car than what would be biologically possible, all while breathing in air at the exact temperature I find comfortable.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this short journey, I arrived at a temperature-controlled building, greeted with a task that if completed correctly, would grant me more 13x the pay that an average Sub-Saharan African would make in the same day. While doing so, I once again selected the exact musical artist from a selection of millions that would suit my tastes for the day. At no point was I concerned with hunger, sickness, predators, violence, or any other of the standard unpleasantness that have been faced daily by 99% of all mammals that have ever existed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, throughout this process, I grumbled over my alarm, grumbled over work, grumbled over my budget, grumbled over what others had that I did not, etc etc.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When comparing my life to someone in the same country, at a similar social class, 200 years ago, my life is incredible and filled with conveniences and luxuries that they couldn&amp;#39;t even dream of. And even those people in the 1800&amp;#39;s were living lives that were free of most of the burdens that other living things face daily. So why hasn&amp;#39;t the modern American had an increase in happiness that correlates with the increase in improved quality of life over the last 300 years?  &lt;/p&gt;

This is mostly directed at mainstream western developers.

For awhile I have gotten a sense that the industry has lost it's sense of innovation for anything but the next and best graphical upgrades and different ways to tell stories. If you take some of the most popular games of the last five years you will notice a focus on story and presentation rather than any real mechanical innovation. God Of War for example is one of these games. I believe it's a good game but if you look at it at a gameplay perspective you realize the only thing original about it is the gimmick with the returning axe, a fun gimmick but a gimmick nonetheless. It definitely has innovations for story telling but gameplay seems to be a second thought. Compare this to many popular games of recent times like The Last of Us. Lots of games tend to have a focus on story over gameplay as though we've completely given up innovation in gameplay. This doesn't mean TLoU gameplay is any bad but sometimes it feels like it was made to fit around the story rather than the other way around.

There are several areas that used to be cared about that seems to just have been ignored. Remember FEAR? Why hasn't there been any significant improvement in enemy AI since it released? Why do we keep going back to cutscenes and non-interactive bullshit? Take Half Life 2 for example, HL2 managed to combine story and gameplay in a way that felt creative, immersed you in a story while never taking the control away. Half Life 2 changed the landscape both for physics based gameplay and for story telling for all games after it. Now it feels like we focus mostly on the story part.

Though expecting everything to be a Half Life 2 in terms of innovation is incredibly unfair so lets use Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite for an example, as I believe the difference between these two games showcase the point I'm trying to make. Bioshock was by all means a great game in terms of both gameplay and story, very much like Half Life 2. It has you explore the city of Rapture while picking up great weapons and powers and slowly unraveling the mysteries of how the city fell all in one package. Infinite has a increased focus on story but somehow manages to have gun play worse than the original game it was based on, powers that all do mostly the same type of thing and it has very linear levels compared to the original. The difference between Bioshock and Infinite feels like the very difference between the 2000s and 2010s in western made games. At least the difference between 90s and 2000s makes sense, 90s were pretty hardcore in terms of gameplay systems so some streamlining is to be expected. But do we really need more streamlining than what we had in Bioshock? Did a game like Fallout 4 REALLY need to remove more depth from 3 and NV?

Maybe we can't have the same type of innovation that Half Life 2 gave us at the time but at the very least we should be working on how we can make great gameplay systems and stories co-exist again instead of being hyper focused on only one. We're playing VIDEO GAMES. I would argue that one of the reasons the Japanese gaming industry seems to be having a nice comeback is because they still put focus on fun and new gameplay. Stop trying to make them into movies and instead tell learn to tell a story in the unique way that only video games can.

I feel like I have many holes in my argument so feel free to tear me a new one. I'm interested in other's opinions of this. And at the very least if you cannot change my mind you can help me make my argument better.

What the majority of people I have talked to do not realize is that consuming beef contributes to deforestation, water pollution, significant water consumption, decreased biodiversity, and dangerous greenhouse gas emissions. Beef is not a sustainable form of protein. Beans are sustainable and significantly cheaper!

Now I am not calling for everyone to go vegan or to 100% stop eating all meat, that is just unrealistic. But, just eliminating one meat source from your diet has such positive benefits I don't see the downside other than taste.

Humans are made so that they need help from others in order to grow up and become functioning adults.

They need not to be hurt, to be educated, to be nurtured, given food and water, and so on and on.

So, it cannot be your full responsibility unless you are like way over adulthood.

But, even then, you largely depend on how you were treated while growing up. 

Say that you developed a medical condition or attachment issues due to a bad upbringing, then you'e fucked.

Also, you still depend a lot on external circumstances for your personal choices.

As for the ""forgiveness"" part, it is also total bullshit.

Many psychological or pseudo-philosophical blogs, especially many popular ones, always include the ""forgive those who hurt you"" part as a step in healing from pain and serious trauma.

Now. First of all, things like trauma, depression, anxiety and such are way more complex than what you can treat with a blog post.

Secondly, the forgiveness thing does the same mistake of the ""it's your responsibility"" formula.

It aims to cure very important problems with just a self-serving, all-abiding formula.

What should be noted is that, however, it is not always good to forgive someone if those have done a very serious harm.

Everything we've put into smart phones to make our lives easier used to be a normal thing we'd go out and do instead of do from our phones. Before social media, you had to make more of an effort to stay in touch with family and friends, but you did it. Phone calls, hand written emails, and just generally staying in touch. Dating meant going out and meeting someone in person, not getting to know then over text before you've even met face to face.

Now, I can't ignore that smartphones and where technology as a whole has come is also beneficial for a bunch of other reasons that don't ""fix"" our lives as much as they enhance them, but all of these capabilities dinish real interactions and investing in the world before it became an option to sit out and do it all from our cell phones instead. It's not worth our privacy, and more people should be worried about it, but they just don't care because the convenience in their lives outweighs everything else. Privacy is more important than what your smart phone offers.

I'd be open to changing my view if I can be convinced of a smart phone benefit/convenience that can't be solved with a real world equivalent for similar results. An example being mobile banking vs going into the bank, going to the grocery store vs online shopping, etc. If there's a function or tech advancement so massive and necessary in our lives, what is it and why is it worth more than my privacy?

Edit: I wasn't very clear on why person privacy is important to me, so let me add that: A lot of it falls on trust, and whether or not a company or these app providers use your information or not, it's still your information. When you share something personal by word, it's trusting the person you tell with that information. If my smartphone can freely use my microphone, location, search history to personalize ads or make suggestions even outside of the time I'm using their product. There's a lack of control and boundaries in one's life when your phone and these apps can just tune into your conversations and listen whenever, or use your location to make suggestions I never asked for. I understand that the world revolves around huge corporations making money, but there's such a thing as freedom of speech and a degree of control over how what I say can be used, whether it's to make my life easier, or just annoy me with copious amounts of ads and spam related to 1 thing I might have mentioned in an out loud conversation or searched on Google.

He wanted criminal justice reform, he wanted to help the opioid crisis here in NH, and he voiced some support for marijuana legalization.

I am hoping for impeachment. I am nowhere near a Democrat, but I would have some respect if they act in the interest of our nation. 

Please don't try to solidify my hate (unless you have very good facts or reasons that haven't been discussed, but even then keep it sparing please) I am looking to see if there's anything I am missing or if I am falling victim to an elaborate propaganda stunt.

Malignant AI - any AI whose actions results in human death or other catastrophe

Benign AI - doesn't cause human deaths

Malevolent AI - an AI who *intentionally* causes human death

Benevolent AI - an AI with the intent to benefit humanity

&amp;#x200B;

Let's assume that the basic way this superintelligent AI emerges is that humans in a lab create some set of conditions which allow it to emerge, they flip a switch, and the AI is ""born"" and at any point they can flip the switch again and ""kill"" that AI.

Also I would argue that human level intelligence should include emotional intelligence and therefore such things as empathy, understanding of life vs death, and valuing human life. A sociopathic person who lacks empathy is considered to have a disorder. There are also people who don't have the intellectual capacity to process language. They're still human but would you call them intelligent? If you created an AI that somehow was incapable of processing language, wouldn't you consider it a failure and shut it down? Likewise, if you birthed an AI that lacked empathy you could easily put this to the test and shut it down. I would assume such a process would happen in essentially a quarantined environment and would involve the launching of multiple AIs rather than just one.

So I foresee the following possible outcomes:

1. No singularity happens, no human level AI is invented or emerges, there's nothing to worry about.
2. The very first superintelligent AI to be born is benign and can immediately help us predict and solve any potential problems with rogue AIs. The people who believe in the singularity think that this superintelligence will be capable of solving any problem far beyond the means of humans so it should be able to solve this problem too.
3. The first and only AI is a malignant sociopath. Humans should be able to test for this, detect it, and shut it down before it causes any real problems.
4. A benevolent AI acts in a malignant way. This is the classic worry that you ask the AI to save the planet and it decides the solution is to kill all humans. But if the AI is benevolent it's not going to hide its motivations from its human managers. All we need to do is put a layer of human review in between the AI's decisions and it's actions. ""AI, how do we save the whole planet?"" ""Kill all humans"" ""No, let's not do that. Bad AI.""
5. A benevolent AI turns malevolent and decides it needs to eliminate humanity and has to trick its human handlers to hide its intentions. But if any other truly benevolent AIs exist, they should be able to anticipate this and protect us against it.
6. There's only one AI, it's born truly malevolent and its human handlers don't realize because it disguises its true intentions. And there are no benevolent AIs around to help stop it. This seems incredibly unlikely, and a simple solution would be again to spawn multiple AIs to try to ensure that you have some good ones to help fight the bad ones as well as testing any newborn AIs in a quarantined environment to make sure they're sane.

&gt;Reasoning that further investment is warranted on the fact that the resources already invested will be lost otherwise, not taking into consideration the overall losses involved in the further investment.

A classic example of sunk cost fallacy is suppose you have a ticket to a concert, but you become sick on the day of the concert and don’t think that you’ll enjoy it. It shouldn’t matter whether you spent $1,000 for the ticket or got it for free, because that money is gone. It’s a sunk cost and it shouldn’t factor into your future decisions.

But here’s my issue with that. I have a number of very positive memories of times when I know that I was sick. Weddings, days at amusement parks, board game nights, whatever. I know they were unpleasant days in the moment, but I still remember the time fondly and hardly remember what it felt like to be sick. I think for many people, the purpose of concerts is to create memories, and if you can suffer through one day of being active and sick at a concert to create a lasting memory, it might be worth it. A good way to gauge what the memory is worth to you is the price you were willing to pay for the ticket when you were well. So if it was a $1,000 ticket, the memory is probably worth the pain of going to the concert. If the ticket was free or very cheap, the memory is probably not worth it.

The following are a few more statements that are supposedly fallacious under the sunk cost fallacy and my attempt to rationalize them. Note that the issue isn’t whether the action itself is objectively reasonable. It’s whether it’s more reasonable if more money, time, etc. has already been spent.

*Ex: I’ve already done 2 years of law school. I might as well just do the third year and finish.*

You should absolutely take into consideration the amount of time you’ve spent in law school when determining if you should finish. If you’ve only been in law school for 3 months, that’s a short enough gap in employment or schooling to not be suspect if you never mention it on a resume. If you’ve been in law school for 2 years, that’s a very significant gap and you would have to mention it on a resume. It’s far better to either finish or never start than to quit after 2 years.

*Ex: If you have already spent an hour watching a movie, and you don’t like it, it’s better to just stay until the end.*

First of all, most movies are comparatively boring for the first hour or so, so it seems unwise to dismiss a movie so soon. But second and more importantly, you now have the first hour of a movie fresh in your mind. You have completed the exposition and a good deal of the plot. It would take you at least another hour to get to this spot in another movie. Compare to if you have only spent 10 minutes in a movie. You may only be through the opening credits and the most basic exposition. You’re only 10 minutes away from this spot if you were to switch to another movie. So therefore it makes more sense to stop watching a movie after 10 minutes than it does after an hour (and if you want to take this to the extremes, suppose you’re mere minutes away from finishing a movie. Certainly quitting then would be less rational than quitting after a few seconds of watching a movie).

*Ex: I’ve already been waiting for this elevator for 3 minutes. I shouldn’t just take the stairs now.*

I’m not an elevator expert, but my sense is that they function on some sort of algorithm to minimize the amount of travel they need to do to get to all the floors that are requested. And I would bet that if you did a study where you keep pressing an elevator call button to see how long it takes, there would be some maximum time that the elevator needs to get to that floor no matter what other buttons have been pressed. Therefore, if you pressed an elevator button 3 minutes ago, it is likely that the elevator will be arriving sooner than if you just pressed it. So it does make less sense to take the stairs if you’ve already been waiting for 3 minutes.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;From logicallyfallacious.com, the sunk cost fallacy is:&lt;/p&gt;

In sports in general, points are awarded for achievement.  The higher the achievement, the higher the points awarded.  The more difficult the challenge, the higher the reward should be.  Points are earned.

Snooker balls are scored as follows:

* Red: 1pt
* Yellow: 2pts
* Green: 3pts
* Brown: 4pts
* Blue: 5pts
* Pink: 6pts
* Black: 7pts

I have no issue with the points allocated to the red balls.  They are very numerous and provide many opportunities for potting.  My issue comes mainly with the high-scoring black ball and the low scoring yellow, green and brown.

Due to the position of the pack of reds, it is easy (for a professional snooker player, at least) to acquire a good position on the black ball following the potting of a red, and to then subsequently acquire a good position on the next red.  This allows a player to easily alternate between potting reds and blacks, quickly racking up a high score.

Much more difficult, would be to get a good potting position on the brown, for instance, before having to get back down the table to the reds.

Therefore, i propose the balls be scored as follows, with explanations...

* Red: 1pt - numerous choice of balls and opportunities to pot
* Black: 2pts - located close to the reds, with enough room between the ball and the pack to allow for easy positional play
* Blue: 3pts - centred on the table, almost equal opportunity to pot in each of the six pockets
* Pink: 4pts - while located nearest to the pack, its very close position often hampers positional play as it can be 'crowded' by the neighbouring reds
* Yellow &amp; Green: 5pts - both are as difficult as each other, though on opposing sides.  Far from the pack, yet their position closer to their respective pockets allows for a decent angle
* Brown: 6pts - level with the Yellow and Green, but centred on the table, i believe this offers the hardest pot when alternating between the pack and the colour due to its position at the baulk end of the table while being centred on the playing area, thus reducing the opportunity for getting angles

My view is as follows:

1a) Loot boxes are not gambling because there is no way to profit. When you play blackjack, poker, slots, bet on a sporting event, etc,  you do so with the expectation that you might profit from the gamble.

When buying a lootbox with untradable loot, you cannot profit. You get a virtual item that cannot be sold for real money. Thus the underlying emotion of greed is not invoked in the same way. It's the equivalent of a happy meal toy or pokemon card pack. 

1B) **""Lootboxes"" sold to minors have literally been a thing for decades.** Baseball cards and tradable card games(pokemon, yugioh) contained random cards, some more valuable than others, that could be sold for a profit.

2.**Gambling is not inherently harmful to minors because they have little to nothing to lose, and can learn from the event**

Gambling can be very destructive to adults. An adult a gambling addiction might throw away their life savings, retirement fund, lose their home to gambling debt, etc. 

A minor has none of that to lose. They can't legally take out debts, and have no assets. At worst, they throw away their allowance and end up feeling bitter about having wasted the money, and they learn a lesson.

**But at the end up the day, they learn a valuable lesson about how they psychologically react to losses.** Some people can handle gambling losses well and view it as fun, others overreact and rage, to the point of throwing away more money to make up for losses. It's much better that they learn while they're young and lose $20, then throw away $50,000 when they're 40 and got drunk at a casino.

Anecdotally, I personally learned to avoid gambling when I was a teenager and played an MMORPG with luck-based enhancing, where if you failed an enhance, your item disappeared. After failing 1 or 2 enchances I would end up blowing up everything in a rage trying to make up for it. It was after that that I realized that I should avoid gambling at all costs as I won't be able to handle it.

Most also say that life begins at conception, defining ""baby"" as a zygote or anything more developed than a zygote.

&amp;#x200B;

Abortion bans accompany and/or create terrible conditions for zygotes, pregnancies, and infants.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Infant mortality: Abortion restrictions consistently accompany high rates of infant mortality, a reliable barometer of the quality and availability of reproductive health care and support for pregnant women in a community, region, or nation. Not only is it a count of actually dead actual babies, but also an indicator that a lot of pregnancies are never making it to term, which again if zygote=baby, you have to count as dead babies.
2. Reproductive health care:  Even prior to pushing through bans or de facto bans, abortion opponents directly and actively restrict access to reproductive health care by standing in front of clinics and yelling. Many of these facilities do not even provide abortions, and most that do spend a much larger portion of their time providing other reproductive health services. More impactful, though, is the chilling effect. Where reproductive health care is tainted by strong stigma against or criminalization of abortion, skilled providers simply leave, and aspiring health care workers choose other fields. Where restrictions and stigma are strongest, women hide their pregnancies and avoid seeking what limited care is available for fear of being jailed if their smile falters or they have a miscarriage (made more common by the added stress and the absence of good reproductive health care). So again, worse conditions for pregnancy, lack of care, and fear of seeking care mean more miscarriages, which if zygote=baby means more dead babies.
3. Health education: Poor or absent sex education is not only comorbid with abortion restrictions, but the same individuals often campaign for both. Pro-choicers will tend to cite the resulting increase in unwanted pregnancies, including teen pregnancies, but poor sex education also means young women have terrible information on how to recognize they are pregnant, how to support a pregnancy nutritionally, medically, or behaviorally, and how when and why to seek medical care. Moreover, there is another chilling effect: fewer and less qualified health educators will work in that region or be produced by it, leading to incomplete and inaccurate information beyond reproduction, for instance in nutrition and exercise. The number of women unable to support implantation, to carry a pregnancy to term, or to birth a viable infant compounds: more dead babies.

&amp;#x200B;

Abortion opponents, you have a trolley problem on your hands. Steering the train away from the baby on the track to the abortion clinic means ten more babies get tied to the alternate track by way of failed implantation, miscarriage, or failure to survive infancy.

I am not necessarily a fan of it by any means, but it’s their body and it’s a decision that they will have to live with for the rest of their lives so I can respect that. I myself have no real ties to abortion and have never had to make any decisions regarding it so I’m very interested to see other people’s point of view. I do agree with abortions regarding rape, incest, or when they are medically necessary for the mother’s health.

The recent uproar with the abortion laws in Alabama has brought forward many celebrities to tell their stories of how they too once had an abortion. At first it didn’t really surprise me because I saw it mostly as one of those “It happened to me too” movements to let women know that they’re not alone. I didn’t think much of it, until I got into some of the detailed accounts of how some of their reasoning (not all of them, but there were some) was that they were just too young, would have been career suicide, or just simply not the time to raise a child. 

It kind of left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I felt like I was basically reading stories saying “look at me, I had an abortion and now I’m a celebrity.” Maybe I’m not qualified to have strong opinions about this, but I just don’t think abortion should be looked at this way in society. These stories and the platform these celebrities have honestly made me feel more unsure about the topic than I ever have before.

I don’t have the right to tell women what to do with their bodies when it comes to abortion or anything else for that matter - that’s not what I want to do. I believe that the celebrities that did come forward with their stories are extremely brave. I just don’t think that celebrities should be influencing young women that it’s perfectly okay/normal to go and get an abortion because it’s not the right time to have a baby (whatever circumstance that may be).

I hope to hear others opinions on this topic to open up a respectful dialogue. Not here to offend anyone and have an open mind.

CMV: Celebrities are influencing young women that’s it totally normal/okay to go and get an abortion and I feel like this is normalizing a decision that should not be taken so lightly.

Thanks all,","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, I (M27) want to say that I believe that women should have the right to choose whether or not they can get an abortion. I am not necessarily a fan of it by any means, but it’s their body and it’s a decision that they will have to live with for the rest of their lives so I can respect that. I myself have no real ties to abortion and have never had to make any decisions regarding it so I’m very interested to see other people’s point of view. I do agree with abortions regarding rape, incest, or when they are medically necessary for the mother’s health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent uproar with the abortion laws in Alabama has brought forward many celebrities to tell their stories of how they too once had an abortion. At first it didn’t really surprise me because I saw it mostly as one of those “It happened to me too” movements to let women know that they’re not alone. I didn’t think much of it, until I got into some of the detailed accounts of how some of their reasoning (not all of them, but there were some) was that they were just too young, would have been career suicide, or just simply not the time to raise a child. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It kind of left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I felt like I was basically reading stories saying “look at me, I had an abortion and now I’m a celebrity.” Maybe I’m not qualified to have strong opinions about this, but I just don’t think abortion should be looked at this way in society. These stories and the platform these celebrities have honestly made me feel more unsure about the topic than I ever have before.&lt;/p&gt;

If anything, I worry that the addicts on film are being paid to remain in their desperate state - they often go on camera uncensored, showing their identifiable features to anyone with internet access.

I think that the general idea of a crew following and recording an addict works for some people-if it didn't, intervention wouldn't have been such a hit.

If the only people who do see graphic drug use are professionals, they can use it constructively to teach safer methods and study the behavior leading up to the actual use.  If non addicts really want to watch people use drugs, they can get into anti drug activism work and help the people who are using.  I do not think that drug use or addicts shouldn't be in the media at all, I think it's important they tell their stories-I just don't understand how it helps them or the public to see them do something that can kill them right there on the spot.

Congress can relatively easily and cheaply fix this by providing more perks of the sort that any employer in its position would offer its employees.

In particular, members of Congress are in effect required to maintain two homes, one in their home district/state, and the other in DC.  Any private employer who wanted to keep an employee in this situation would provide for a hotel or a longer term rental for the employee in one of the locations.  Congress should do the same by building a dormitory or apartment building for its members.

There's plenty of room to do so.  The Capitol complex has tons of insanely wasteful surface parking lots south of the Rayburn and Longworth buildings.

&lt;p&gt;Congress can relatively easily and cheaply fix this by providing more perks of the sort that any employer in its position would offer its employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, members of Congress are in effect required to maintain two homes, one in their home district/state, and the other in DC.  Any private employer who wanted to keep an employee in this situation would provide for a hotel or a longer term rental for the employee in one of the locations.  Congress should do the same by building a dormitory or apartment building for its members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s plenty of room to do so.  The Capitol complex has tons of insanely wasteful surface parking lots south of the Rayburn and Longworth buildings.

I believe that the following example (specifically) and medical assistance in dying (generally) represent perhaps the clearest example of a 'good' death. 

This is the original thread: https://twitter.com/DavidJuurlink/status/1129811903776198659

“I'd like to share some reflections on the death of a patient. I’ve thought about her a lot.

She gave me explicit consent to tweet the details of her case, about four hours before she died. Her hope was that someone might benefit from her experience.

&gt; She came to hospital as octogenarians often do: with generalized weakness, falls, poor oral intake, fever, hypotension.

Her WBC was 17,000. Blood cultures grew E. coli.

Sepsis. Fixable enough.

&gt; But she also complained of pain in her groin and thigh. It was new, progressive and debilitating.

Even moving around in her hospital bed was agonizing.

&gt; A month earlier, she’d been found to have a large pseudoaneurysm arising from her external iliac artery.

(And yes, that’s a screw from a previous hip replacement traversing it.)

She underwent stenting and returned home.

&gt; Because she was septic and in pain, we scanned her again. The new CT showed extensive gas within the pseudoaneurysm.

It was now infected, and that was a big problem.

&gt; We continued antibiotics. She improved. We got her pain under reasonable control with hydromorphone and various other meds.

But then came the big question: “Now what?”

&gt; She wanted no more surgery. Her mind was now sharp, and she was clear about that.

But antibiotics alone weren’t going to cure the infection; they would only suppress it.

The best option, we suggested, would be antibiotics for the rest of her life.

&gt; We discussed this option at length. She didn’t want it either. She explained why.

Pain was one reason. Meds helped a little, as long as she didn’t move around much. But our drug options were limited, and pain was going to be a persistent problem.

&gt; Her even greater concern, looking forward, was quality of life.

Over the preceding months, she’d lost her mobility and independence. She wasn’t going to get them back and she knew it.

&gt; She foresaw being confined to her apartment, in pain, struggling with her walker.

No more walks outside. No trips to the grocery store. No playing bridge with her friends, as she had done for years.

She wasn’t interested in living like that.

&gt; We discussed palliative care: stopping antibiotics, increasing her pain meds, and keeping her comfortable while the infection took its course. Her family would keep vigil at her bedside for as long as it took.

She wasn’t interested in dying like that.

&gt; She knew she was nearing the end of her life. What she wanted, she told us, was for it to end peacefully, with her mind still sharp, and her family and friends present. She wanted medical assistance in dying (MAiD).

&gt; We held a family meeting. Relatives came from near and far.

They were unconditionally supportive. As it turned out, she’d discussed the prospect of MAiD, were it ever to become an option, several times in recent years.

So that became the plan.

&gt; I saw her every day after that. Managed her pain. Listened to her stories. Learned about family members who’d died, and whose deaths had influenced her decision now.

Never once did she reconsider. I grew very fond of her, especially her wit and clear-eyed stoicism.

&gt; After the requisite waiting period and medical assessments, the day had come.

I visited her at 7:30 that morning. She was alone but upbeat, eating Cheerios and toast from her tray.

(I still regret that this was her last meal. Wish I’d brought her a fresh bagel with lox.)

&gt; A few hours later, her room was packed with family and friends. It was literally a party.

There was talking and laughing and cognac in Dixie cups. The mood was anything but funereal.

They gathered around her bed. I took a group photo. Everyone was smiling.

&gt; I then watched as a colleague reviewed everything one last time, confirmed her wishes, explained what would happen, and answered everyone’s questions.

“Okay, I’m ready,” she said. Her composure was remarkable.

“Goodbye everyone. Thank you for everything. I love you all.”

&gt; She received midazolam and dozed off peacefully, her children holding her hands and stroking her head.

Next came propofol, an anaesthetic. Then rocuronium, a muscle relaxant. Finally, potassium chloride, to stop her heart.

Five minutes after saying goodbye, she was dead.

&gt; There were tears, of course. All around. But mostly the atmosphere in the room was one of serenity and gratitude, and a genuine sense of having done the right thing.

&gt; I’m no MAiD expert, and I get that some people are opposed to it for various reasons. But I’ve been a doctor for 25 years, and I’ve seen enough deaths to know a good one from a bad one.

This was, without exaggeration, the best death I have ever witnessed.

&gt; We all die eventually. This patient helped me realize that when my time comes, I'll be fortunate if MAiD is an option.

And I will always be thankful to her, her family, and a very skilled colleague for helping me appreciate just how good a “good death” can be.""","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;What follows is an anecdote that went viral on twitter from an internal medicine physician (Dr. David Juurlink) who has witnessed many patient deaths.

So religion is nothing you can feel and it's only known to us because people in the past were talking about it and wrote stories about it. I'm sure that is not debatable, but I'm up for discussion.

Now for my personal view and opinion:
It's what people made out of it, that is the interesting part. People took stories seriously and made a real thing about it just like if I read Harry Potter and was able to convince a lot of people in the future, that J K Rowling was a medium and the story she told influenced a certain part of our world to some degree. Isn't it weird, that religions are different and how people believe in different stuff despite living on the same earth? It obviously happened due to a lack of real source or scientific facts (or any facts really).
In my opinion people keep holding onto it because it either helps them in miserable situations (like, god please help me through this) or they learnt they would be punished for their sins and fear for their 'afterlife'.
From personal experience, I don't know anyone who really believes in anything non-existent (just let me call god non-existent in a sense that he can't be proven), except for people that are weak and can't rely on themselves and their strong will to get through life. I also knew people from school when I was a kid, that had strict religious parents, that made their kids believe in god, but without questioning it once you are old enough to think rationally, you will keep believing in it.
I don't mind theories that try to explain stuff as a lot of the science we believe in nowadays is broad too, but people are not interested in that and rather take something that is socially justified to get back to or even explain their misbehavior with.
So if all humans forgot about religion, in a long time, they would again have an excuse for everything and we had new religions that helps justifying stuff we are not man enough to stand for.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t mind that people need to believe in something like a god, this is more about the origin and how people adapt to it.&lt;/p&gt;

I stumbled upon the simulation theory a few months ago. At first glance I was quite skeptical, but the more I read the more it began to make sense. I read an article where a group of researchers were able to encode physical strands of DNA with malicious software.  DNA + computer viruses?  Then I stumbled upon another researcher who discovered ""error-correcting"" code in string theory equations while he was studying quartz, electrons, and supersymmetry. 

I know the more research that is done in quantum mechanics the more we're noticing the traditional laws of physics aren't applying.  So where does that leave us?  

As our technologies improve so does our own abilities to create simulations.  I grew up playing NES then Sega and eventually PS1/2 and the graphics today aren't even in the same realm of comparison. From movie CGI to computer games the details are amazing. So who's to say someone hasn't perfected this and begun their own 'grandfather' simulation or a theoretical simulation on 'x.' If the technology was so sophisticated would we be able to tell?  As with all technologies glitches should be present, right?  Error-correcting software should catch most of those and what's left, r/glitch_in_the_matrix stories. Even if only a fraction of a percent of the stories are true what would that mean?  What about the Mandela effect? 

There's so much out there and of all the plausible theories on life, to me, simulation theory makes the most sense.

These classes commonly have a goal of improving critical thinking skills and develop advanced literacy. However, the format of current history courses where students heavily analyze past events, does not emphasize critical thinking, but rather focuses on memorization of history that has little to no significance in the present. Literature classes that focus on deep analysis of *important* texts like Shakespeare's works, complex poetry, or stylistic writing (i.e. stream-of-consciousness in ""Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man"") do not develop readinc/writing skills applicable to students' lives or modern texts. They also tend to foster dislike for reading when students are forced to extract meaning from texts they do not value or understand.

I believe a courses in debate, critical analysis of nonfiction works (i.e. argumentative opinion pieces), or even literary analysis of more familiar works would all be better alternatives to detailed US history or general literature courses.

Since this is a broad statement with caveats, I'll clarify in a list:

- I am not arguing the classes offer zero value. The concept of being in an educational environment likely has benefits itself, so my view will not be changed by arguments of the form ""all education has value"".


- I acknowledge the value of basic history lessons in understand society, culture, and history that affects us today. I am arguing that there is little to no value in all students having to learn of details like specific battles of the Civil War, or the politics of the early 1800s. These topics should be pursed electively.


- I am not arguing that these classes lack value only because they do not tie to future careers. I believe these two courses majorly fail to provide value. I agree that math and science courses do not necessarily tie into future work, but I believe they accomplish their goals more effectively.

I admit I may display a STEM-favoring bias due to my field of study and work, so I am willing to accept arguments that show that my view is a function solely of my bias and not of reason.

EDIT: Want to clarify that I still think history should be taught at a general level in school. I don't think it should be as detailed or exhaustive as a part of the core curriculum. In other words, I think the necessary history can be taught in fewer total classes

Largely when in a public setting people bring up ASI being a problem they are shot down as getting their information from terminator and other sci-fi movies and how it’s unrealistic.  This is usually accompanied with some indisputable charts about employment over time, humans not being horses, and being told that “you don’t understand the state of AI”.  

I personally feel I at least moderately understand the state of AI. I am also informed by (mostly British) philosophy that does interact with sci-fi but exists parallel not sci-fi directly. I am not concerned with questions of employment (even the most overblown AI apocalypse scenario has high employment), but am overall concerned with long term control problems with an ASI. This will not likely be a problem in my lifetime, but theoretically speaking in I don’t see why some of the darker positions such as human obsolescence are not considered a bigger possibility than they are. 

This is not to say that humans will really be obsoleted in all respects or that strong AI is even possible but things like the emergence of a consciousness are unnecessary to the central problem. An unconscious digital being can still be more clever and faster and evolve itself exponentially quicker via rewriting code (REPL style? EDIT: Bad example, was said to show humans can so AGI can) and exploiting its own security flaws than a fleshy being can and would likely develop self preservation tendencies.

However, there is one I have developed a strong opinion on: the postal service.

Growing up in Romania, I have seen with my own eyes how privatizing the postal service reduced its quality, in terms of delivery speed, care with the packages, making sure letters don't get lost, etc.

I moved to Denmark and noticed the same trend here: stories from everyone on just how much worse the postal service got after becoming privatized.

On the other hand, in the US, where everything from hospitals to prisons are private, the USPS is still a part of the government! I don't know much about how good the USPS is, I just ordered a package from the US, and in less than 30h from shipping, it already arrived in Denmark! It's been a week *since it got clear by customs*, and I am still waiting for my package, which is currently in a distribution center in my city, and I am not allowed to pick it up myself.

It's not a matter of needing more free market competition, since we have GLS, FedEx and other services here, and they're also used quite often.

To change my view, I think I'd need one of the following:

* an example of a country with privatized postal services where the service is really good, or better than it was previously as a government service under a capitalist democracy
* how the USPS is actually terrible, and my anecdotal evidence was just a fluke. It would take at least a few stories, or statistics, not ""my packet was late/lost this one time""

What will **not** change my view:

* how a previously private postal service was taken over by the government, and it got worse. I am sure there are several failing, corrupt governments out there that managed to make things worse.
* how it saves taxpayers money to privatize this. It most likely will! But it will also decrease the quality, is my opinion, and whether it's worth paying extra for better services is a good question for a separate discussion.
* how people shouldn't be forced to pay for a service, as a principle.

Before I begin though, I will say that there definitely are times when the sub is better than the dub. If I can't stand the voice acting of the dub, then I'd much rather watch the sub. Or other times, the lines are so melodramatic that it grates in your native tongue but reading it in a sub is a much different experience that won't get that same negative reaction from you.

Or hell, maybe you just don't feel like waiting for the dub to come out if the sub is already here.

But if we assume that the dub is well-done, then my following points make a lot of sense.

**Anime is a visual media.**

The more you're looking at the visuals and less reading text on the bottom of the screen, the better. The main advantage a screen has over a book is that you can see and hear the motion and the audio--if you're READING as this is happening you're missing out on some of that. 

**Localization can be weird.**

Some phrases *directly* translated from Japanese are just...awkward in English. Plenty of times I read something on a sub and I think ""I've literally never heard anyone say that phrase in my entire life."" However when an anime is dubbed it's usually localized into an equivalent, familiar phrase in English. (E.g. nobody says ""unsightly"" over here in normal conversation. Like...ever. But holy hell it's like a catch-all word in a sub. Never shows up in a dub though.)

**Humor gets lost.**

Comedy depends a *lot* on timing. However, the speed at which a character speaks and the speed at which the subbed text appears on the screen are often not lined up at all, so you end up reading the 'punch line' moment before it's even happened to the characters. This diminishes funny moments. 

**Emotion and inflection are more easily detected in your own language.**

Sure, I keep hearing that if you watch enough subbed anime, you get better at this. But it's still true for anyone who doesn't exclusively watch subs for a very long amount of time.

It is easier to empathize with characters if you can truly hear the happiness or sadness or pain or anger in their voice. You might be able to build up your ear for Japanese but there's just not much incentive to, given all of these points.

So in conclusion, if the dub is good, just watch the dub. Unless you don't want to wait or you think the dub is just wack.

Examples of anime I watch dubbed because I find the dub to be amazing: Fullmetal Alchemist, My Hero Academia

Examples of anime where I hate the dub so I watch it subbed: Attack on Titan

Example of an anime where I don't wait for the dub, and don't *especially* like the dub: One Punch Man

So it's not that I never watch subs but I don't think people should be elitist and scoff at dubs simply because they're dubs. A dub is not bad just because it is a dub. Some dubs ARE garbage though, so I don't fault anyone who avoids those (if you can't stand the voice of the main character, how could you ever enjoy watching it?) but dubs should be given a chance. There are plenty where I can find absolutely no fault in their voice acting so why not watch it instead of try to watch and read it at the same time?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;All things being equal, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

Why would you care if someone else modifies your work if you don't care about redistribution. Your work will still exist in its original form and people can still use it. You might be afraid that someone will make your work better and more popular somehow. Well, then either use Share Alike so you can take the work and improve it as well, creating an awesome feedback loop. Or put it under full copyright. CC-ND is just in the middle that gives neither the benefits of copyright nor the benefit of share culture.

&amp;#x200B;

You could even consider it a weak copyright. Sure anyone can distribute your work verbatim, but wouldn't they just get your work from you. If you are using a creative commons license your work is probably free. The only thing it does is go against remix culture. Why?

&amp;#x200B;

The only reason I can think of is an actively harmful modification. If someone modifies your CC software to distribute malware or modifies your CC video to promote hate. And they attribute you according to the terms of the license. You can be under hot water. I don't think that happens though. Feel free to correct me.

Don’t you want to give your baby the best start? Do you not care about your baby? If you are this selfish you probably shouldn’t have kids.

I learned in nursing school that mastitis and cracked or bleeding nipples, or feeding too often, means you’re doing it wrong and need a lactation consultant. Given the unfortunate century we’ve had where women don’t breastfeed and therefore the women able to impart the old world wisdom about techniques are all dead, we are stuck. The closest thing we have are people from developing countries and lactation consultants who can and should revive this tradition that’s as old as humankind. 

I believe that women who don’t breastfeed (and it always seems to be due to convenience, based on my friends who never bothered) are selfish, unless:

1) they take medication they need to survive or function that is dangerous to babies and transmitted through breast milk. 

2) they risk losing their job or not being able to pay the bills if they don’t work 

3) if the baby doesn’t latch despite many trips to a doctor or lactation consultant 

4) if the baby is lactose intolerant and/or doesn’t agree with the milk despite dietary changes

5) if the mother has insufficient or nonexistent milk supply and continues to despite the advice of her lactation consultant. 

6) If mother or child are too sick. 

7) the mother formula fed before it became widely known that breast is best. 

For example: When I was born in 1990, my mother thought that breastfeeding was for poor people that transmits pollutants and toxins to babies (thanks, formula lobby!) and that formula is an improved version of it (the popular opinion at the time). My brother (1993) was breastfed for six months until he weaned naturally and my sister (1997) couldn’t because my mother was sick with puerperal fever (yes, actually) for 3 weeks after the birth and by then didn’t have supply. All of these don’t make my mother selfish (but hiring a 24hr baby nurse and not bonding with her baby just so she could sleep despite being a SAHM does, but I digress). 

TL;DR: mothers who choose not to breastfeed solely “for convenience” (unless they have to work to survive or keep their job) are selfish.

I said ""at least advocate"" in the title because I am aware that there are people who would like to be vegan/vegetarian, but are unable to do so.

I think it is pretty clear from the title, I belieave that the idea of being pro life clashes with the idea that it is okay to eat/kill animals. Being pro life should be about protecting life and preventing suffering of the innocent (or at least that's how I view it) and animals are exactly that. Except they are not human. But I don't really think that's relevant. If they are capable of feeling pain and capable of suffering (which they are) they should be treated as such. It doesn't really matter which species they are. It seems kind of weird to me to be protecting an unborn, undeveloped life (especially early in the pregnancy when it can't feel pain yet) and completely disregard the sufdering of very much developed lives. Not only disregard but indirectly ""have part in it"" (by eating meat and supporting that industry). Also, women usually don't get abortions because they feel like it, but because they have to (because they can't take care of the baby etc.) and we don't really need to kill animals anymore. This is what makes it even more ""paradoxical"" for me. That a person wouldn't be okay with ending a life from necessity, but would be okay with casually ending lives for the taste of meat (as long as they are not human). 

I see examples of my friends and people in general who are very much pro life and don't care even a little bit about becoming vegetarian. I guess I would like to understand that or see if it is really logically inconsistent to have these views or if I'm wrong.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I said &amp;quot;at least advocate&amp;quot; in the title because I am aware that there are people who would like to be vegan/vegetarian, but are unable to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

I, like many that have been keeping up with GoT, was utterly disappointed in this most recent season. However, I encountered today a criticism of the final episode that hadn't occurred to me when watching or discussing it afterward, which was the one advanced by Lindsay Ellis in [this tweet thread](https://twitter.com/thelindsayellis/status/1130543549311623168) (link to the start). While I wish I could directly engage with the person that prompted the question, I have a realistic understanding of my non-famous-Youtuber chances of being noticed, and talking to anybody else who agrees with her on Twitter seemed like a piss-poor way of getting anything close to a coherent debate, both because of the nature of Twitter's short-form communcation and how echo-chambery followers tend to be.

In short, Lindsay posits that Jon killing Dany was an example of a trope that's often used by domestic abusers, wherein they inflict harm on their victims but see themselves as the real victims for having been ""forced"" to inflict said harm, using some actions of the victim to justify it.

Instinctively, I felt this was wrong/inapplicable, but I thought that it was possible there's some aspect to this that I'm missing and/or is in my personal blind spot. And so I turn here.

My initial response/rebuttals is/are as follows: 

1. Jon doesn't see himself as a victim. Throughout the whole episode, he's very clearly conflicted about having to do it, but even after he goes through with the murder, he seems perfectly willing to accept the potential consequence of execution by dragonfire when Drogon arrives -- indeed, he almost seems to expect it. He seems willing to accept some punishment/consequences for what he did.

2. Jon's actions were justified. Granted, this is something of a subjective judgement, but Dany's claim that she was going to bring liberation to Westeros's serfs, peasants, and other mistreated underclasses rings quite hollow after an episode in which she'd just burned hundreds of thousands of innocent peasants just because she felt hurt and alone by all that she had lost. She's very clearly lost sight of the goal she set out for, and is willing to commit further atrocities in the name of ""liberation"". Lindsay partially addresses this by saying that ""of course his actions seem justified, that's how the show writers want to portray it"", but that seems to be a rather crucial difference for me -- the actions of a domestic abuser aren't justified, even if they think they might be, because society deems them unjustified. And both our society and (at least on the surface) Westerosi society deems Dany's actions in burning down King's Landing after they'd surrendered as justification for ending her reign. After all, if Dany was justified in bringing Cersei down for her blowing up the Sept of Baelor and other mistreatment, then Jon must be justified in bringing her down for doing the same thing but on a much larger scale.

3. Jon has to be convinced to take action. He doesn't see what she does and immediately decide ""imma stab her"" -- he needs to talk to Tyrion, and needs to be convinced of the necessity of it, and even then he refuses until Tyrion points out that not only is Jon as the ""obvious heir"" likely to be treated as a threat and executed next, but his sisters (who've shown some antagonism to Dany) are liable to be on the list as well. And even after all that, he doesn't seem certain about its necessity, and goes to talk to Dany, which brings me to my next point:

4. Jon attempts reason before violence. He doesn't see her as a threat until he tries to talk her out of her position, tries to make her see that she's becoming as much a tyrant as those she had fought against and meant to keep fighting against. It was only after it became clear that she couldn't be convinced and couldn't be made to see that she had lived long enough to become the villain (indicated by her line of ""They don't get to choose"" or something to that effect) that he decides he has no other choice.

I think that there's no reason to kill it that late in pregnancy, **unless the mother's life is in danger making it an unfortunate necessity**. If there are any other reasons for choosing abortion, it could have been done at earlier stages before the developing baby gained sentience, so there's no excuse.

&amp;#x200B;

""Women have a right to do what they want with their bodies.""  Agreed.  But that right ends if you are killing another.  My right to swing my arm ends where your nose beings.  

&amp;#x200B;

""What about in cases of rape and incest.""  While those are terrible situations to be in, they have no affect on wether or not a fetus is a life, nor the morality of abortion.  Rape and incest are arguably less of a crime than murder and therefor we can not negate a more major crime because another less serious crime occurred.  And also, just because someone was raped or incested (i know thats probably not the right word), it doesn't justify the killing of someone else.  

&amp;#x200B;

""Men shouldn't make decisions about women.""  They should.  Everyone, men and women, deserves a say in what is acceptable in a society.  Just because a policy disproportionately affects one group, doesn't necessarily  mean that the policy is wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Men are making these laws to try to oppress women.""  A little off topic, but I have a hard time believing that men (mostly republicans) are creating these abortion laws because they want to oppress women.  It just doesn't make sense.  For one to want to oppress someone, there needs to be a way to benefit from it.  For example, people oppressed black people to become slaves because they benefited from the cheap labour.  I don't see how these people are going to benefit from banning abortion.  If anything, people who have abortions tend to be disproportionately black or hispanic ([stats](https://www.guttmacher.org/infographic/2017/abortion-rates-race-and-ethnicity)).  Most of these people tend to be Democrats and because people tend to take the political ideologies of their parents, by banning abortions, you could argue that there will be an increase in left-wingers, something that Republicans would not want.  Wether or not it would have significant weight in an election is unknown but it wouldn't surprise me.  Therefor I don't think that these people are creating more restrictive abortion laws to oppress women but are doing it because they truly believe that it is a life.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, I am pro choice.  The reason being, ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" is required to convict someone of a crime and we can not yet say based on the evidence we have that a fetus is a life beyond a reasonable doubt. However, if one day, scientists were able to prove with 100% certainty that a fetus is a life, I would switch my position.

So the main issue I want to discuss is whether or not calling out a mentally ill person's bad behaviour is a fair thing to do or not.

We can choose to ignore and tolerate the socially unacceptable actions of the mentally sick person because we understand that they are not good at making judgements, and that if we choose to intervene, we risk hurting their feelings and self-esteem, which would worsen their mental condition.

Excuse me for my perhaps bigoted views, I don't have anything against homosexuals, I wish them nothing but the best and I understand that saying that they have a mental disorder is derogatory but this is just something that I feel and I want to change my view on it.

For starters

&gt;A **mental disorder**, also called a **mental illness**[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder#cite_note-2) or **psychiatric disorder**, is a behavioral or mental pattern that causes significant distress or impairment of personal functioning.

I am taking this definition and more precisely the ""impairment of personal functioning"" part.

Would it be wrong to say that the important evolutionary mechanism of the opposite sex being attractive to oneself (because it is one of the steps to having offspring) would be **impaired** if you were homosexual and wasn't attracted to the opposite sex.

I do understand that homosexuals are perfectly capable of having kids, however, they are very less likely to do so than heterosexuals.

In a societies with 100, 50 and 10 percent homosexuals, the one with 10 percent would be the most likely to survive in the long run.

I do not think homosexuals are not normal, I understand they are everywhere in nature and human history. I just think because they are impaired in the sense I mentioned that they have a disorder.

Why is my view wrong and please change my view. Thanks!

So far my experience in the dating game has shown me that women are just simply not worth the the trouble. The common argument, especially from most men is ""what about the sex?"". With all due respect, I have the internet and my right hand for that, in other words women aren't even worth dating for THAT reason. 

The other reason I believe dating isn't worth it is because simply attracting, and seducing a woman into liking you be it sexually or romantically is by far in a way the most difficult and damaging (to mental health) task a man these days can do. In the era of online dating women (and men too for that matter) can and will be way more picky in who they choose, more often than not we forget that people tend to look more attractive in person than in photos so we will swipe left on people simply because their first impression was bad. That left swipe essentially eliminates that person from your dating pool forever thus making it harder for them to date. 

That being said, when a man does match with a woman on tinder, more often than not she is flooded with matches, and not only that, but she is flooded with messages, majority of which are generic ""hey's"", ""Hi's"", and the occasional ""what's up"". And I understand why a woman wouldn't want to reply to each and every single one, however more often than not the woman that is being flooded with messages forgets that most men get little to no matches and then when he messages her wanting to have a genuine conversation and see where it will go, he gets no reply, thus making him feel unattractive, boring, and hopeless. The man will either sulk, fix his problems, or give up. 

Another issue with dating (again from a male perspective) is that women simply just have no spine. From my own experience women can't be honest about how they feel about a man, whether they like him or not. They can't even be honest to their biology (I've heard more guys say that they want a girl with an hourglass figure than girls say they want a guy who earns 6 figures🙃) 
And women simply lack logic, I've had girls match with me and message me first with so much enthusiasm only to unmatch me less than a day later, Seriously where the hell is the logic in that? Women can't be honest about what they like in a man either, whether it's personal preferences or biological hardwiring. This leads to many men being confused and irritated.

The next and final point I want to bring up is valid for both genders. Dating these days to simply put it, seems to just be a one way street. Men are expected to do all the initiating, men are expected to empathize with women's situations and men are expected to put in all the work to maintain the relationship. The problem isn't that women these days don't seem to want to put in work to keep a relationship, the problem is that nobody wants to understand each other's situations. I personally, can somewhat understand why women are the way they are. But most guys can't, and that leads to them thinking that women owe them, thus creating the ""incel"" mentality. The unfortunate outcome is that everyone just becomes adverse to eachother

TL;DR dating these days isn't worth it because the risk is greater than the reward.

I'd like to hear a female perspective on modern dating, since my CMV was from a male perspective. I will admit I'm quite young, therefore I'm basing my input from an 18 year old male perspective, but I'd like to change my view and see the positives in dating. I genuinely feel as if I will end up living a ""bachelor's"" life, with no wife or family because of how the risk outweighs the reward when it comes to dating.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;DISCLAIMER: what i an about to say will sound very demeaning, rude, and in some ways dehumanizing, so unless you are prepared to change my mind without getting heated I suggest you click away, also this is coming from a male perspective so there will be bias&lt;/p&gt;

But most guys can&amp;#39;t, and that leads to them thinking that women owe them, thus creating the &amp;quot;incel&amp;quot; mentality. The unfortunate outcome is that everyone just becomes adverse to eachother&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR dating these days isn&amp;#39;t worth it because the risk is greater than the reward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to hear a female perspective on modern dating, since my CMV was from a male perspective. I will admit I&amp;#39;m quite young, therefore I&amp;#39;m basing my input from an 18 year old male perspective, but I&amp;#39;d like to change my view and see the positives in dating. I genuinely feel as if I will end up living a &amp;quot;bachelor&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; life, with no wife or family because of how the risk outweighs the reward when it comes to dating.&lt;/p&gt;

I can think of no good reason that measurements in cups are still so common beyond a stubborn reluctance to adopt a clearly superior system. If I understood a practical reason why people insist on volume measurements I might find the whole business less irritating. My reasons are:

* Kitchen scales are cheap and easily available, and are not substantially more expensive than a full set of measuring cups.
* They are considerably more precise than volume measurements, as 1) cups can vary considerably in volume, from near 200ml to as high as 250ml (edit - see [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cup_\(unit\)) wikipedia page for an outline of different systems with differing volumes), and 2) equivalent weights of ingredients often do not occupy the same volume, e.g. packed vs unpacked flour (edit - or differently chopped fruit, veg, etc.).
* Linked to the above, recipes using weight will be more consistent in their results, and closer to what was intended by the recipe's author.
* There is less washing up associated with measuring by weight - all measurements can be done by adding directly to the mixing bowl, with no need of numerous additional containers.

Exceptions to this:

* Measurement of oil-based liquids, where there is not a neat 1g:1ml ratio may be better to measure by volume, especially as these are often directly added to hot pans so would be difficult to weigh.
* Very small quantities, less than 1tsp, are likely better measured with an appropriately sized measurement spoon due to the limits of precision in cheap kitchen scales.

Arguments that will not change my view:

* ""Scales are still more expensive than cups"" - the cost of scales is under £10, and as such is comparable to most basic kitchen equipment, such as pots and pans.
* ""People are used to volume measurements, and manage fine with them"" - acknowledgement of this is why my view is ""measurement by weight is superior"" rather than ""all recipes should use weight measurements""

What would change my view:

* A significant advantage of volume measurements that I am unaware of.
* Evidence that my perceptions of the advantages of weight measurement are not accurate.
* Evidence that the cost of kitchen scales is an insurmountable obstacle for a large enough number of people that it would be unfair to ask them to convert from weight to volume measurements (i.e. the majority of people).

Edit: Most new comments seem to be rehashing the same points as older ones. The general consensus seems to be:

* Weighing is more precise. Agreed
* Precision isn't always that important. Also agreed
* Volume is more convenient. Disagree - as best as I can tell my disagreement on this one is due to a combination of differences in common container sizes for flour, etc. in the UK vs the US, and differences in relative levels of practice with different methods of measurement.
* Cheap scales are bad at very small quantities. Agreed

Though I am more or less pro-life, I do have a pragmatic streak which I did not think carried in this discussion.

Fundamentally, on the morality of abortion, it comes down to whether that fetus is a person. Which begs the question of what a person is. I know I am a person, I consider you a person, we are all people and have some fundamental understanding of personhood. However, the definition of a person is unsatisfying. Are people in comas people, how about truly brain dead individuals. Are babies people? My dog can reason better than a baby but she is not a person (well I kind of think so but I have trouble extending that to dogs that are strangers whereas I don’t have that issue with people). What I’m getting at is that physiological and neurological function are insufficient definitions.

Furthermore, when we consider individuals, we might ask what makes theoretical Jack a person. One can imagine that through some rare quantum event, our theoretical Jack popped into existence for a moment in deep space then the subatomic particles fell back apart. Is spaceman Jack a person? What if those particles arranged such that they mimicked the memories or personality/brain structure of an earthman Jack? I think then we could say no, he is not a person. Especially if the guy falls right apart after a femtosecond.

Instead we recognize that a person is not just the present physical structure but the culmination of at least the past and the present. It is my experiences, thoughts, and physical influences that culminate in my present. It is to say that time is an important aspect of who we are. Furthermore, it can be said that the me ten minutes ago was a person and me now is a person. Indeed, barring tragic death, me in ten minutes will be a person. Furthermore, we recognize that until death I will be a person, going so far as to consider even brain dead humans as persons. Note that we do not kill people on life support, we let them die.

It then strikes me that physiological function does not determine my personhood, rather it is an indelible characteristic humans have which exists from conception until death. If my person hood exists when I’m 1 month old and when I’m seventy years old, it exists from my inception until death. My person is not defined by the present, it is defined by what I have done and what I will do. A convenient thought exercise might be to consider a 5 year old Maya Angelou. She has not yet written her poems but that person is nonetheless that person. Unless action is taken, she will fulfill that future and her personhood extends through that life. Your personhood extends for who/what you were through who/what you will be.

Thus it must be recognized that abortion is the killing of a person, an act we consider immoral.

My view is contingent on the moral standing of the fetus as a person. I furthermore assert the premise that killing persons is immoral even if the outcome is personally or socially beneficial (i.e. its immoral to sacrifice people, especially unwilling or non-consenting, even if it does keep the sun shining and rain falling).

I am open to concerns on the definition of personhood, whether it does indeed extend through time, if it starts at conception, but not its worth. I'm sure there are holes here and hope to have them explored. CMV

But at the end of the day considering it took two years just to write and film 6 episodes you have to imagine just how expensive and daunting that task was by itself.

For anyone upset about the ending. I hear you. I get it. I will make one argument though.

""Have you watched the last 7 seasons?""

First we are hit with the death of Ned Stark someone who is honorable and good. We are given the Red Wedding. The death on Obyrn. All these terrible things happened in the series and we all wanted a good conclusion. It just was never going to play that way.

- We saw Daenerys rising up from nothing, hiding, scared, abused, and alone. Rise from nothing to become one of the most powerful people in the world. We loved her because she says, ""In my bones this is right and this is wrong. I have Dragons and I believe I can fix this."" When Tyrion pointed out that, ""We cheered her when evil men died and said nothing. All the while she grew more power and the belief that she is right.""

We dont need a major explanation further than that. Dany was good, and in a way is STILL good, but her way was always accept my view of the world or death. We never questioned it just like the viewers because these people were evil. However, she never provided justice. She provided her view of the world and believed she was destined to move forward and change the world. Even if we truly believe in someone's view how we get there as well is what matters. Everyone saw what she did to Kings Landing. Whatever drop of mercy, whatever bit of love she had left was gone. She wanted power just as bad as Cersei did. Even if her views of the world was just and good. 

Jon, Tyrion, and other just couldnt accept her iron grip on that. What they had to become to get there. The deaths of innocents to do that. Her view was paradise. Her view involved genocide. If the ruler of a keep does not bow to my new order then there are no small mercies. There is only Fire and Blood. 

- As for Jon, and I had to think about it, why on Earth did it matter that he was Aegon Targaryen when his goal is to be exiled. Jon has always been a Bastard. Hes been treated like one forever. He exiled himself to get away from the problems of The North and Westeros as large because he had no life. However, he took the teachings of his surrogate father Ned Stark to heart and did what he truly believed would be right and just. He sacrificed himself and even died to do what his right. 

It's almost poetic in a way.

This prince that was promised was the true heir to the Iron Throne. Downcast all his life he rose up and saved thousands of Wildings despite centuries of differences. He rose up and became King of the North even though he didnt want it to save and protect his people. He pledged himself to a woman that he loved because he truly believed she would save the world. He united men, armies, and people to put aside their differences and survive until the dawn. He did something horrible, kill a woman he loves and served without question, because he knew he and the world couldnt follow her path. An action he still isnt sure was the right thing to do. 

It didnt matter that he is a Targaryen. It never did actually. It was a misdirect for the viewer. A belief that he would rise up and become the king he was supposed to be. That was never Jon's fate and never would be. Everything he did was for the good of man and his reward is exile from the Seven (excuse me Six) kingdoms. The show never promised a happy conclusion. It promised the conclusion that made sense. No one will ever truly understand and appreciate the sacrifice the last Targaryen made to really save the world. W

We arent left to believe the Kingdoms will truly be better with Bran. We arent left to believe there wont be conflict, issues, problems, squabbles, or a lasting peace. We are left to believe that these people are going to move forward one step at a time and rebuild the world the best they can. 

At the end Dany became the very thing she promised to end. A Tyrant. There is no grey or middle of the road for a Tyrant. ""What if the other people really believe what they are doing is good.""

""They dont get to choose."" She says. Only a ruthless dictator deals in absolutes. Even if their intentions is pure.

Jon is who he is. A true hero. A true hero doesnt get the reward. His role is only sacrifice. There is never reward for sacrifice.

Even in a fantasy world there are parables to medieval times and reality. We all just do our best and do what we believe is the best in the face of a cruel world. There is not perfect ending. We just continue on.

In short, the idea is that life is never woth living, because:

Life contains positive  and negative aspects.

If someone doesn't exist, they 100% avoid all negative aspects and miss out on all positive aspects.

But the thing is, while they would miss out on all the good things, this could not bother them, because they don't exist.

So let's even if someone worked in their dream job, had a great social life, never experienced tragic losses, their worst injury was as sprained ankle and they died peacefully at 90 years old, this life would not have been worth it, since if this person wouldn't have existed they avoided all discomfort/suffering, and while they would have missed out on all the good things, this wouldn't have been a problem because they wouldn't have been able to know what they are missing.

&lt;p&gt;Exceptions because no risk killing innocent, and I&amp;#39;ll accept the &amp;quot;you can mature&amp;quot; argument up until 18, then I don&amp;#39;t believe you&amp;#39;ll change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overpopulation is an issue, and why should we treat criminals with MORE respect than we might treat others, and have all these rights to respect useless people. Why is human life worth any more than Cow, for example, which we kill without thought.&lt;/p&gt;

For those out of the loop as to why the hell I'm conflating milkshakes with political violence, these two Google searches should help clear things up ([1](https://www.google.com/search?q=tommy+robinson+milkshake&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS838US838&amp;oq=tommy+robin&amp;aqs=chrome.2.0j69i57j0l4.4355j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8), [2](https://www.google.com/search?q=sargon+of+akkad+milkshake&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS838US838&amp;oq=sargon+of+akkad&amp;aqs=chrome.4.69i57j0l5.4634j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)). TL;DR: people are responding to those that they disagree with politically by throwing milkshakes at them.

The thing that stuck out to me, though, and the central part of the CMV post, is that this form of political activism seems to have pretty widespread support; [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/bq73dp/burger_king_on_twitter_dear_people_of_scotland/) is a post from r/unitedkingdom where both Burger King and most of the 300+ comments on the post seem to approve, explicitly or implicitly (the latter in the case of BK), of throwing food at your political opponents. I'm rather confused by the widely held support for this activism but, given that it is widely held, I figure I might be missing something - hence CMV.

I should also note that I'm not a fan of Tommy Robinson or Carl ""Sargon of Akkad"" Benjamin or the ideologies they push; while I will be referencing these particular cases, my view applies fairly evenly to all modes of violent political activism. Here's my rationale:

1. First, and lets just get this out of the way, what is being done here is physical assault. As far as physical assaults go I agree it's a pretty mild form, but still physical assault, regardless. It seems to me that the gold standard of political discourse/disagreement should be not to physically assault those on the other side.
2. It seems to me that ""well it's just a *mild* form of physical assault"" serves to normalize physically assaulting people because you disagree with them politically; since we've crossed over from the gold standard of physically assaulting them not being okay, it seems to me the only remaining question is how severely you get to physically harm them. Human nature being what it is, I see no reason why this won't escalate to fists, bricks, cars, or bullets eventually. Indeed, we've already seen several examples of people using fists, bike locks, cars, and bullets to engage in a more extreme form of the same type of physical assault activism that the milkshake throwers are engaging in.
3. There seems to be some notion that if the ideology of the person being physically assaulted is bad enough it justifies the assault. Again, human nature being what it is, I have absolutely no faith that people will be, for lack of a better word, responsible about who they physically assault. In the case of Robinson and Benjamin, the milkshakers and their supporters argue that the assaults are okay because both of those individuals are Nazis/fascists. I'm not particularly interested in discussing if Robinson and Benjamin specifically actually are Nazis/fascists, but I will note that I, like pretty much anyone who has ever been on the internet for more than five seconds, have realized that terms like ""Nazi"" and ""fascist"" are used at the drop of a hat, generally just to slander political/ideological opponents and very rarely used as an accurate label of an actual Nazi or fascist. As such, the terms are fairly meaningless in common language; at least on the internet, they're used to describe everything from a card carrying white nationalist like Richard Spencer to a mildly strict high school teacher. The way these terms are applied is extremely subjective and often arbitrary. We've seen similar inaccurate slandering with terms like ""socialist"" or ""communist,"" and we've had many people, such as the US president, inaccurately slander whole demographics of people (e.g. Mexicans) as such things as ""rapists."" In short, even if we grant (and I don't) that it's okay to physically assault someone if they *actually are a literal* Nazi/communist/rapist/extremist, etc., I see absolutely no reason to believe that people will restrict their vigilantism to people who actually belong in any of those categories. Point and case: the woman who got pepper sprayed for wearing a red hat that looked sort of like a MAGA hat. If we can simply agree that it's not okay to physically assault your political opponents then there's no need to worry about mistakes or abuses of that vigilante power happening, so I don't really get the support for this kind of activism.
4. Speaking of vigilantism - that's also what this is, in addition to being physical assault. Every developed country has laws on the books that regulate things like hate speech or incitements of violence. If you feel that a political figure has violated one of these laws and poses a danger to society there is a legal recourse available to you - foregoing that recourse to instead violate the law yourself by both physically assaulting someone and inciting violence against them seems counterproductive, and puts you outside the law, not them.
5. And speaking of that, I think it's bad for the image of whatever cause you're championing. If you go over to T\_D right now there's a whole bunch of pictures of people like Carl Benjamin covered in milkshake with titles like ""this is what the peaceful and tolerant left looks like."" And fuck me for ever agreeing with something on T\_D, but they kind of have a point on this one. I'd think that if your actions, when captured in a picture, make someone like myself who normally hates T\_D agree with their analysis of your actions, maybe they were bad actions.
6. Lastly, and a big one, I see no evidence that this physical assault approach to political activism ""works"" in the sense that it actually helps shape the political landscape more in your favor. While I'm sure it's very cathartic for the people throwing/in support of throwing the milkshakes at specific individuals, what does it actually accomplish? The people getting assaulted don't seem to change their views because of this so far as I'm aware. Their followers do seem to become more radicalized as a result, though, and the divide between the ideological opponents grows. There was a lot of violent opposition to Hitler and the Nazis when they were working to take over Germany, and far from dissuading them the violence and deplatforming was used as propaganda and a recruitment tool for the Nazis. So that'd be a big one for me, and perhaps something I'm missing: is there any evidence that street-level violence actually ""works"" when it comes to dissuading or eliminating the political opposition? Is there some grand strategy I'm missing here?

I am very concerned about women and queer rights, and I believe that any serious attack on the endemic problem of sexual harassment and abuse must include harsh penalties, including those that may be considered ""extreme.""

I will now define my terms. By sexual harassment, I mean what any reasonable person would consider inappropriate sexual activity, either by place or by relationship. I would thus not consider kissing a friend on the cheek to be ""sexual harassment"" under these definitions, but I would if it were done again against a ""no."" For the penalties I suggest, public masturbation, groping, hidden cameras, and using one's power to pressure another to engage in sexual acts would be considered sexual harassment, assault, and/or abuse.

I believe that the chronic social problem of women being assaulted and abused sexually, a problem that has existed in most civilizations since time immemorial, can only be truly dealt with through grave penalties. I will now list what I consider reasonable penalties.

* If someone sexually assaults a healthy and non-vulnerable adult, leniency should be applied when the perpetrator is remorseful, and this would be entail lifelong chemical castration.
* If the offender is somewhat remorseful, their crime should be punished with physical sterilization.
* If the person is not remorseful or has a high probability of reoffending, they should be sentenced to death.
* In the gravest sexual crimes, such as violent child molestation, sexual abuse of the disabled, and sex trafficking, the perpetrator should be used for scientific or medical experimentation, saving the lives of innocent laboratory rats, dogs, or chimpanzees.
* If someone decimates hardcore pornography to a person under the age of consent, they should be punished by at least lifelong chemical castration.
* Anyone who commits a sexual crime and is not sentenced to death or medical experimentation must take and pass a mandatory women's, queer, and sexual minorities' rights class

These laws would need to be strictly enforced. These penalties, though they may seem harsh, should be enough frighten and prevent most perverts and sexual deviants from offending, and those that do offend will be taken out of society, cleansing it of such pollution.

This does not mean I think people are secretly saying ""Of course this isn't true, but I will lie about it"". This does not mean that there don't exist exceptions where people would engage honestly.

&amp;#x200B;

Why I hold it:

Every time I have this conversation with someone, this claim is made, and every time when I point out the logical consequences of this belief (e.g. that it would require mandatory adoption in cases where that would provide a better home for the kid) I am met with various sorts of intellectual dishonesty and never an actual argument that addresses or concedes the point.

Ways to change my view:

1) Show me that I'm wrong about there existing an inconsistency in the first place. While it's possible to argue dishonestly for true things, people can also be terrible at identifying their true reasoning. If they have the benefit of actually being right, I'm more likely to believe that they're doing their best and the signs of intellectual dishonesty are because they don't know how to argue any more coherently.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Show me that there is a line of argumentation that is difficult to articulate and can remain convincing even in the face of the kind of arguments I've been providing, even if it does not ultimately hold up once articulated.

&amp;#x200B;

2) If there is a strong majority response of ""yes, I'm the kind of person who says that it's all about the children and I know it's not 100% true, but this is not dishonest because I am completely willing to clarify this when it comes up"". I say ""strong majority"" because how things are framed changes how people respond (and who will respond), and even if there is a weak majority here it is likely that without this framing the response would be different.

&amp;#x200B;

3) If there is a strong majority response of being willing to engage honestly about the existence of the contradiction, even if such discussion does not change my mind about the existence of the inconsistency or even the existence of arguments which don't immediately fall apart when challenged. Minds changing on the other side would be proof of honesty, but lack of change would not be proof of dishonesty.

The trauma of being forced to carry their rapist's child (and possibly have to share custody or co-parent with said rapist) is essentially ignored. They offer adoption as an alternative but it does not fix the problem of spending 10 months pregnant with the constant reminder of your attack nor is adoption always an option (in some states you cannot give up a baby without the father's consent, even if he raped you or he can file for sole custody of the baby if you don't want it). Forcing anyone to carry a baby they don't want is cruel in my mind but this is especially true for cases where the child's very existence is a reminder of trauma.

2. For pro-lifers who do allow for abortions in cases of rape of incest, their argument is not ideologically consistent. If you honestly believe that abortion is murdering a baby then it should not matter how the ""baby"" was conceived. A rape baby and a baby conceived through consensual sex are not biologically different, so if aborting one is murder the dame is true for the other. While this stance is less harsh than the above, it is less rooted in ideology and makes it look like all the person cares about is controlling women's sex lives. I still believe this is a cruel stance because it forces people to carry and give birth to babies when they do not wish to and violates their bodily integrity.

It borders on an obsession, especially after I understood the idea that humans are story telling animals and that stories, in both a book full of pages sense and in broader more abstract sense, are how we built our civilisation. I read books, watch films, television shows etc and I always analyse the structure of the story. I have codified the rules of narrative personally, however as Kurt Vonnegut discussed this all so brilliantly long before me, I will summarise him instead of myself ([you can watch him talk about narrative structure here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oP3c1h8v2ZQ&amp;list=FLmiw6j_yrgJJ1u1D9P9gjzg&amp;index=4&amp;t=0s)); basically his point was that for classical stories, that is to say 99% of stories, they all conform to a basic structure. In Act 1 introduce a character that the audience can identify with (i.e. an average person in an average situation or an average person in either a very bad or very good situation that the audience can still identify with as they can see themselves potentially being in such a situation) and towards the end of Act 1 have something happen that alters their situation. Then in Act 2 have them struggle with that situation and then finally in Act 3 it all resolves and we get a happy ending.

Classic examples of this are; for the average person starting off in an average situation, the 'Boy Meets Girl' story (i.e. boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back again). For the average person starting off in a very bad situation, the 'Cinderella/Rags to Riches' story (i.e. girl lives in poverty, girl gets chance to escape poverty to riches briefly but ends up back in poverty, after a struggle girl regains riches). For the average person starting in very good situation; 'The Count of Monte Cristo' (i.e. boy is on top of world with successful career, beautiful wife, lots of friends, boy is cast down to the depths of despair when all this is taken away from him perhaps including something like imprisonment and then finally regains his former status or better and then gets revenge).

In which case, when you understand narrative structure, Game of Thrones was never going to resolve in a satisfying way.

My reasoning for this is that if you are not going to follow the classical narrative structure that I outlined above, then you have got to be writing something unique. Vonnegut himself did this unique work many times. For example 'Slaughterhouse 5' where the narrative constantly jumps around in time and often appears to have no real destination in mind other than getting ideas across to the reader. Or 'Breakfast of Champions' where the book often takes the form of a conversation between Vonnegut and the reader where Vonnegut consistently breaks the fourth wall and talks about the ""end"" of the story long before we actually get there.

However this unique type of writing is not for everyone and will only really be enjoyed by a small audience, most stories that most people enjoy are within classical structure (and in fact even people that do enjoy unique writing like Vonnegut's probably still read, and enjoy reading, far more classical narratives than they do the former type). Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice &amp; Fire is, for all its subversion techniques, classical narrative structure through and through. George Martin's trick for getting his classical narrative structure books noticed amongst the crowd however, was to consistently subvert narrative structure. However, as he was still caught within the classical narrative structure that his audience wanted and that he had chosen to write in, these subversions could only be temporary or happen to characters that were ultimately unimportant and probably only created to be subverted in the first place. So he creates a Cinderella, but then kills her before she completes her narrative arc. He creates a Count of Monte Cristo but has his narrative take wild, unexpected turns, he creates an average boy that meets a beautiful girl, whom then loses this girl, but she turns out to be a witch anyway. And why not throw in a quantity of sex and violence that would never normally be seen in such a story as another subversion.

But in the end, you have to bloody well get on with the story. The only alternative is to do something really crazy, like have the bad guys win or an asteroid hit or something, but if you are going to do something like that, you have to start out that way (like Vonnegut) and for all his subversion techniques, George Martin did not start out like that. He started out classically and attracted a classical narrative audience that expect certain things.

And so slowly but surely, all the classical archetypes start plodding towards their classical conclusions. But, now you have the problem of having got your audience hooked on your 'subversions'. So two choices remain; keep subverting to the very end or quit the subversions and just wrap it up normally like the centuries of writers before you from Shakespeare to JK Rowling. If the GoT/ASOIAF keeps subverting and does not end with some sort of ""happy"" ending, then the classical narrative fans will be upset and wonder why they bothered watching/reading at all if they were never going to get to see one of the heroes end up on the Iron Throne. If you stop the subverting and wrap things up with a nice classical narrative bow then the subversion fans will be upset because they will wonder why they bothered watching/reading at all if everything was just going to end up as expected like it does in every other story anyway? With a happy ending and all that.

So my point is, that with the way in which George Martin set up his shop, there was no real way for the story to end in a way that would satisfy a majority of the audience. He would either end up undercutting the subversion style he had been using for over two decades (i.e. providing a 'happy' ending) or ending in some crazy way that upset the fans that had followed these characters for so long and wanted so badly for them to succeed. In summary, the story was fucked from the beginning regardless of how much time, money or effort was put into the books or the television series.

&amp;#x200B;

The best the fans could really hope for was that at least the journey would be worth it. That the characters development and the interactions and dialogue would make it all worth it.

&lt;p&gt;My reasoning for this is that if you are not going to follow the classical narrative structure that I outlined above, then you have got to be writing something unique. Vonnegut himself did this unique work many times. For example &amp;#39;Slaughterhouse 5&amp;#39; where the narrative constantly jumps around in time and often appears to have no real destination in mind other than getting ideas across to the reader. Or &amp;#39;Breakfast of Champions&amp;#39; where the book often takes the form of a conversation between Vonnegut and the reader where Vonnegut consistently breaks the fourth wall and talks about the &amp;quot;end&amp;quot; of the story long before we actually get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However this unique type of writing is not for everyone and will only really be enjoyed by a small audience, most stories that most people enjoy are within classical structure (and in fact even people that do enjoy unique writing like Vonnegut&amp;#39;s probably still read, and enjoy reading, far more classical narratives than they do the former type). Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice &amp;amp; Fire is, for all its subversion techniques, classical narrative structure through and through. George Martin&amp;#39;s trick for getting his classical narrative structure books noticed amongst the crowd however, was to consistently subvert narrative structure. However, as he was still caught within the classical narrative structure that his audience wanted and that he had chosen to write in, these subversions could only be temporary or happen to characters that were ultimately unimportant and probably only created to be subverted in the first place. So he creates a Cinderella, but then kills her before she completes her narrative arc. He creates a Count of Monte Cristo but has his narrative take wild, unexpected turns, he creates an average boy that meets a beautiful girl, whom then loses this girl, but she turns out to be a witch anyway. And why not throw in a quantity of sex and violence that would never normally be seen in such a story as another subversion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the end, you have to bloody well get on with the story. The only alternative is to do something really crazy, like have the bad guys win or an asteroid hit or something, but if you are going to do something like that, you have to start out that way (like Vonnegut) and for all his subversion techniques, George Martin did not start out like that. He started out classically and attracted a classical narrative audience that expect certain things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so slowly but surely, all the classical archetypes start plodding towards their classical conclusions. But, now you have the problem of having got your audience hooked on your &amp;#39;subversions&amp;#39;. So two choices remain; keep subverting to the very end or quit the subversions and just wrap it up normally like the centuries of writers before you from Shakespeare to JK Rowling. If the GoT/ASOIAF keeps subverting and does not end with some sort of &amp;quot;happy&amp;quot; ending, then the classical narrative fans will be upset and wonder why they bothered watching/reading at all if they were never going to get to see one of the heroes end up on the Iron Throne. If you stop the subverting and wrap things up with a nice classical narrative bow then the subversion fans will be upset because they will wonder why they bothered watching/reading at all if everything was just going to end up as expected like it does in every other story anyway? With a happy ending and all that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my point is, that with the way in which George Martin set up his shop, there was no real way for the story to end in a way that would satisfy a majority of the audience. He would either end up undercutting the subversion style he had been using for over two decades (i.e. providing a &amp;#39;happy&amp;#39; ending) or ending in some crazy way that upset the fans that had followed these characters for so long and wanted so badly for them to succeed. In summary, the story was fucked from the beginning regardless of how much time, money or effort was put into the books or the television series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best the fans could really hope for was that at least the journey would be worth it. That the characters development and the interactions and dialogue would make it all worth it. But it seems like it did not work out that way doesn&amp;#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;

1. All States are given a say in Federal matters, and their own local issues
2. Given the tax structure of the country, we have donor and receiver states
3. That said, States themselves can engage in politically detrimental and ruinous governing structures, and be propped up by this financial balancing system - in other words, bad decisions cost them far less than it would if there was no transfer of funds. 
4. This problem ultimately falls on the electoral college because it props up this financially consequence-free system. 

The electoral system allows States to act like ideologues with no consequences while well-managed states have to clean up the mess either through direct tax transfer. e.g. All States give the Federal Government a $1, but New Jersey for example gets back .63 cents while New Mexico gets back $2.19.

Additionally, this exacerbates sprawl (inherently costly for obvious reasons) in places where it should least exist.
