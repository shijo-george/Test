&gt;Tonight, Evelyn Hardcastle will be killed... again.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;It is meant to be a celebration but it ends in tragedy. As fireworks explode overhead, Evelyn Hardcastle, the young and beautiful daughter of the house, is killed.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;But Evelyn will not die just once. Until Aiden – one of the guests summoned to Blackheath for the party – can solve her murder, the day will repeat itself, over and over again. Every time ending with the fateful pistol shot.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;The only way to break this cycle is to identify the killer. But each time the day begins again, Aiden wakes in the body of a different guest. And someone is determined to prevent him ever escaping Blackheath... 

 

This month we will be reading *The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle* by Stuart Turton. 

The dates of and links to the discussion threads can be found in the sticky comment on this post. You are welcome to read at your own pace. Don't worry about joining later on in the month. Usually it is pretty easy to catch up, but you are always welcome to join the discussions a little later.

Stuart Turton will be joining us for an AMA on **Friday, June 28.**

If you 'follow' the book club post you will receive a notification when a new post, a discussion thread for book club, is added to the collection. It is still being tested, so it may not be perfect, but perhaps it will make it easier to join the discussions when they go up.

 **The Rules**

 * Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.

 * All suggestions made in this thread must be direct replies to other people's requests. Do not post suggestions in reply to this self-post.

 * All unrelated comments will be deleted in the interest of cleanliness.

 **How to get the best recommendations**

 The most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.

 ____

 All Weekly Recommendation Threads are linked below the header throughout the week to guarantee that this thread remains active day-to-day.  For those bursting with books that you are hungry to suggest, the suggested sort is new; you may need to do this manually if your app or settings means this does not happen for you.

 If this thread has not slaked your desire for tasty book suggestions, we propose that you head on over to the aptly named subreddit /r/suggestmeabook.

What were Kurtz's 'immense plans'? Was it to break free of the Company and establish himself as the supreme using his influence over the natives? Is that why he is referred to as a threat to the Company? !&lt;

So what attracts him (and everyone) to Kurtz so much? !&lt;

He's part of the mafia so you know he's super tough and dangerous, but he's also such a great guy he's always a little bit set apart because he's not like those BAD mafia guys.

I'm a woman, and I love a good love story. But guys, don't you like love, too? You fall in love in real life. Do you not want to read love stories, and if so, why not? Do you feel like love stories aren't published (by this I mean written and marketed) with you in mind? Maybe you do like to read love stories, and I'm just ignorant. To me, it seems that love stories are published based on the idea that love is for women and the LGBTQ community. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with that. I'm happy we have love stories, and people love to read them. I'm just curious why we have this idea that guys don't want or like to read them.

Now you find there is no way through. Only seconds are left, each one strangling you a little more tightly. Incantations are spoken all around. They have lost their power. The living and the dead jabber inside you. You cannot understand them. Dreams become more lustrous than memories. Darkness is shoveled over dreams.

Those unblinking eyes are still gleaming through the mirror, the eyes of that face, smiling too much and too long. And you can feel your own face smiling, too, your eyes not blinking. Now that secret you never wanted to know comes into your head—that you were made as you were made and manipulated to behave as you behaved. And as this secret comes into your head, the smile of that face pushes up at its edges. So does yours, doing as it is bidden. Both faces at once are smiling the same smile. It widens past all sane proportion. At last a long-restrained voice cries out: *What is this life!* But only silence answers, and it mocks every mad hope you ever held.

*No self now, consciously speaking.*

*No feeling your old self or new self, false imaginings if you thinking about it, self-conscious nothings everywhere you look.*

*No one to hear you weep or scream, making a go of it on your own, bye-bye.*

*No bosom of nature, abandoned on the doorstep of the supernatural, minds full of flagrantly joyless possibilities, a real blunder that was, the human tragedy.*

*No reality to speak of, nobody here but us puppets, contradictory beings, mutants who embody the contorted logic of a paradox.*

*No immortality, ordinary folk and average mortals coming and going, can't stay long, got an appointment with non-existence, no alternative to consider, being alive was all right while it lasted, so they say.*

*No life story with a happy ending to tell, only a contrivance of horror, then nothingness—and nothing else.*

*No free will-to-live, no redemption by a will-to-die, how depressing.*

*No philosophies to peddle, pessimism a no-sale, optimism had to close its doors, too wicked to pass code.*

*No mechanisms or mind-games, repressional mechanisms broke down, self-deception shuttered its windows.*

&amp;#x200B;

—Thomas Ligotti, *The Conspiracy Against the Human Race / Chapter 7*","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you hoped to make it through this horror that sat like a gargoyle upon your life. Now you find there is no way through. Only seconds are left, each one strangling you a little more tightly. Incantations are spoken all around. They have lost their power. The living and the dead jabber inside you. You cannot understand them. Dreams become more lustrous than memories. Darkness is shoveled over dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those unblinking eyes are still gleaming through the mirror, the eyes of that face, smiling too much and too long. And you can feel your own face smiling, too, your eyes not blinking. Now that secret you never wanted to know comes into your head—that you were made as you were made and manipulated to behave as you behaved. And as this secret comes into your head, the smile of that face pushes up at its edges. So does yours, doing as it is bidden. Both faces at once are smiling the same smile. It widens past all sane proportion. At last a long-restrained voice cries out: &lt;em&gt;What is this life!&lt;/em&gt; But only silence answers, and it mocks every mad hope you ever held.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No self now, consciously speaking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No feeling your old self or new self, false imaginings if you thinking about it, self-conscious nothings everywhere you look.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No one to hear you weep or scream, making a go of it on your own, bye-bye.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No bosom of nature, abandoned on the doorstep of the supernatural, minds full of flagrantly joyless possibilities, a real blunder that was, the human tragedy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No reality to speak of, nobody here but us puppets, contradictory beings, mutants who embody the contorted logic of a paradox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No immortality, ordinary folk and average mortals coming and going, can&amp;#39;t stay long, got an appointment with non-existence, no alternative to consider, being alive was all right while it lasted, so they say.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No life story with a happy ending to tell, only a contrivance of horror, then nothingness—and nothing else.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No free will-to-live, no redemption by a will-to-die, how depressing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No philosophies to peddle, pessimism a no-sale, optimism had to close its doors, too wicked to pass code.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No mechanisms or mind-games, repressional mechanisms broke down, self-deception shuttered its windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No awakening from a dream within a dream, mutation of consciousness—parent of all horrors, best not mess with it, extinction looking better all the time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No more pleasure, what there was of it, a few crumbs left by chaos at feast, still a good supply of pain though.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

While I do agree that this does not give you any idea what the book is about, I think it does a better job at telling you whether you will enjoy the book or not, which is why I want to defend it. I know the creator of the original post said that mainly nonficion books have this issue, but it is still present in fiction, and as I do not have any nonfiction books with this issue present at the moment, I do have examples from fiction books.  

When I picked up *The First Law* trilogy by Joe Abercrombie, the first thing to greet me was praise from George R. R. Martin saying ""Joe Abercrombie is doing some terrific work."" Similarly, when I picked up *The Cold Commands* by Richard Morgan, I saw a quote comparing Morgan to Abercrombie, and then a quote from Abercrombie himself endorsing Morgan. Even though both *The Blade Itself* and *The Cold Commands* have synopses, I didn't have more than a single glance at either before reading the books. I enjoyed both, and entered them without knowing anything about either except that they most likely right up my alley since they are endorsed by authors whom I trust. Authors I've read and at least somewhat enjoyed, whose words I respect. It was the was the same when I picked up *The Wise Man's Fear* by Patrick Rothfuss and saw a genuine review from Brandon Sanderson, as well when I picked up *Nevernight* by Jay Kristoff which (on my edition) has personal praise from Rothfuss. I haven't finished either of those two, but I have enjoyed them immensely thus far. And again, I believe that they're telling the truth, simply because it seems like they've actually read the book, and wanted to write a review about it.

There are also examples of books I've bought for the synopses and now that I've read them, I wish I'd read their praise first. The easiest examples to bring up are Sarah J. Maas' *Throne of Glass* and its prequel, *The* *Assassin's Blade*. The premise of an assassin that has lost everything and is given another shot at life but has to fight for it sounds amazing! And without turning this post into a criticism of the *Throne of Glass* series, I'll condense it into one sentence: what I found most enjoyable was criticizing it. The prequels were even worse as its synopsis is simply wrong, but that is something I found out while reading the thing. However, another thing I noticed while reading the prequels is that it has a page for praise, and none of them are really saying what is good about the series except for ""the plot is riddled"" and ""enthralling, thrilling and beautiful."" These sentences aren't really specific for *Throne of Glass* and could be copy-pasted onto another book without anyone really noticing. While on the other hand, what Sanderson says about *Wise Man's Fear* are precise ideas that couldn't and wouldn't be plastered to just any book.

One last example is actually my personally favourite book: *The Silmarillion* by John R. R. Tolkien. My copy has a synopsis that could simply be a random praise, but a praise that is printed right below the synopsis, is from The Guardian and asks ""How, given little over half a century, did one man become the creative equivalent of a people?"" That quote alone is the majority of the concept of what I recommend about Tolkien when I get the chance to recommend his work. How beautifully it's written, and how wonderfully rich his world is. I don't recommend *The Silmarillion* because it's the ""legendary precursor to The Lord of the Rings"" like the synopsis says.

So where am I headed with all this? Well, to give a short conclusion: praise may not always tell you what the book is about, but with experience it can tell you whether it's a book you'll like. Of course, there are exceptions: some books you'll like and some books you won't, regardless of synopsis or praise. But even so, how I treat it is if the book only has the simple ""breathtaking,"" then unless that's from a source I can trust or respect, then there really isn't anything to give praise to and I might as well just continue on my list instead.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently saw &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/c0juw9/an_irritating_publishing_trend/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x""&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; (titled: &lt;em&gt;An irritating publishing trend&lt;/em&gt;) bringing attention to the topic regarding publishers not printing a synopsis on the back of books, instead printing reviews that may simply say &amp;quot;breathtaking.&amp;quot; While I do agree that this does not give you any idea what the book is about, I think it does a better job at telling you whether you will enjoy the book or not, which is why I want to defend it. I know the creator of the original post said that mainly nonficion books have this issue, but it is still present in fiction, and as I do not have any nonfiction books with this issue present at the moment, I do have examples from fiction books.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I picked up &lt;em&gt;The First Law&lt;/em&gt; trilogy by Joe Abercrombie, the first thing to greet me was praise from George R. R. Martin saying &amp;quot;Joe Abercrombie is doing some terrific work.&amp;quot; Similarly, when I picked up &lt;em&gt;The Cold Commands&lt;/em&gt; by Richard Morgan, I saw a quote comparing Morgan to Abercrombie, and then a quote from Abercrombie himself endorsing Morgan. Even though both &lt;em&gt;The Blade Itself&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Cold Commands&lt;/em&gt; have synopses, I didn&amp;#39;t have more than a single glance at either before reading the books. I enjoyed both, and entered them without knowing anything about either except that they most likely right up my alley since they are endorsed by authors whom I trust. Authors I&amp;#39;ve read and at least somewhat enjoyed, whose words I respect. It was the was the same when I picked up &lt;em&gt;The Wise Man&amp;#39;s Fear&lt;/em&gt; by Patrick Rothfuss and saw a genuine review from Brandon Sanderson, as well when I picked up &lt;em&gt;Nevernight&lt;/em&gt; by Jay Kristoff which (on my edition) has personal praise from Rothfuss. I haven&amp;#39;t finished either of those two, but I have enjoyed them immensely thus far. And again, I believe that they&amp;#39;re telling the truth, simply because it seems like they&amp;#39;ve actually read the book, and wanted to write a review about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also examples of books I&amp;#39;ve bought for the synopses and now that I&amp;#39;ve read them, I wish I&amp;#39;d read their praise first. The easiest examples to bring up are Sarah J. Maas&amp;#39; &lt;em&gt;Throne of Glass&lt;/em&gt; and its prequel, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Assassin&amp;#39;s Blade&lt;/em&gt;. The premise of an assassin that has lost everything and is given another shot at life but has to fight for it sounds amazing! And without turning this post into a criticism of the &lt;em&gt;Throne of Glass&lt;/em&gt; series, I&amp;#39;ll condense it into one sentence: what I found most enjoyable was criticizing it. The prequels were even worse as its synopsis is simply wrong, but that is something I found out while reading the thing. However, another thing I noticed while reading the prequels is that it has a page for praise, and none of them are really saying what is good about the series except for &amp;quot;the plot is riddled&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;enthralling, thrilling and beautiful.&amp;quot; These sentences aren&amp;#39;t really specific for &lt;em&gt;Throne of Glass&lt;/em&gt; and could be copy-pasted onto another book without anyone really noticing. While on the other hand, what Sanderson says about &lt;em&gt;Wise Man&amp;#39;s Fear&lt;/em&gt; are precise ideas that couldn&amp;#39;t and wouldn&amp;#39;t be plastered to just any book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last example is actually my personally favourite book: &lt;em&gt;The Silmarillion&lt;/em&gt; by John R. R. Tolkien. My copy has a synopsis that could simply be a random praise, but a praise that is printed right below the synopsis, is from The Guardian and asks &amp;quot;How, given little over half a century, did one man become the creative equivalent of a people?&amp;quot; That quote alone is the majority of the concept of what I recommend about Tolkien when I get the chance to recommend his work. How beautifully it&amp;#39;s written, and how wonderfully rich his world is. I don&amp;#39;t recommend &lt;em&gt;The Silmarillion&lt;/em&gt; because it&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;legendary precursor to The Lord of the Rings&amp;quot; like the synopsis says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where am I headed with all this? Well, to give a short conclusion: praise may not always tell you what the book is about, but with experience it can tell you whether it&amp;#39;s a book you&amp;#39;ll like. Of course, there are exceptions: some books you&amp;#39;ll like and some books you won&amp;#39;t, regardless of synopsis or praise. But even so, how I treat it is if the book only has the simple &amp;quot;breathtaking,&amp;quot; then unless that&amp;#39;s from a source I can trust or respect, then there really isn&amp;#39;t anything to give praise to and I might as well just continue on my list instead.&lt;/p&gt;

Okay so I might be a little biased. I honestly thought it was better than Beartown because we got more Benji POV’s. I loved exploring the relationships between people and seeing people come to each other’s side at the worst. 

I’m also very fascinated by their new coach, Elizabeth Zackell. I like her unorthodox methods of coaching, and she just doesn’t give a fuck haha. 

Three things. 

1. Can someone in simple terms please explain to me what Richard Theo did to Peter? In one chapter it says Peter realized he was being manipulated all long. I was very confused by the political/sponser plot throughout this entire book. Sorry if this is a dumb question.

2. I hate Ana. I don’t care how insensitive I sound and hopeful people will agree with me. She’s a wasted character and I find her annoying. Maya has more depth and we don’t deserve Benji for forgiving her (Ana) for what she did to him. Childish and immature, especially since he never gave her the idea that he liked her anyways.

Ready Player One book and movie are essentially two completely different stories set in the same universe, with many different references to the 80s. Likely, when they made the movie they had to change a few things up, because even though the book is from 2011, some things were already outdated (e.g. in the book they still write blogs, while in the movie players are on twitch). Also I find that the movie references more well-known geek artifacts, as opposed to the book that focuses a lot on old arcade games that many younger people probably never heard of (among many, many other 80s references).

In sum, the two are vastly different experiences, so it is definitely worth to check out both. I actually find it hard to compare the versions entirely, because of how different they are. Only one things that really bugged me in the movie version: The bad guys are more of a joke you're supposed to laugh at, while in the novel, they are actually a scary vision of a corporate-controlled future, in which capital surpasses the value of a human life (if we haven't already reached that future!). On the other hand, though, I really loved the actor they chose for Halliday. He has the perfect voice for both an awkward real-life geek guy, and the wizard avatar Anorak.

But i decided to give the first few chapters a read anyway, and good heavens, it is marvelous.

Reading through all the written etiquette makes you wonder where it all went, in just 100 years, it has all but vanished, the carefully laid rules of ones life, not heeded anymore.

Throughout it gives you etiquette and rules of politeness thou must follow, even little things, like giving your lady the right-hand seat on your carriage, something that does not exactly apply to today's motorcars, but it will make you think the next time a lady will be traveling in your vehicle, shall you or not, give the lady the right-hand seat? 

Chapter after chapter you will feel that you have been writing the wrong way, talking to people the wrong way, greeting wrong, and doing nearly everything wrong.

It not as so brainwashes you on how to live, but rather the messages conveyed go deep into your mind, into your heart, where they will forever be respected, you will want to bow down to all your friends, be helpful to ladies and fellow gentlemen, you will not want to brag about your new luxury car, not after you read this book anyway.

It will also make you think of the rudeness and impoliteness around you, all the things in the book that it claims to be ""indicative of ill-breeding"" can be found in everyday life, out in public, at the diner, everywhere, and certainly most of the written etiquette that does not apply today can be skipped, but not all of it, most of it still applies and is very important to modern living, and it certainly is sad to think that knowledge and use of these written rules is waning, some may disagree, and while gentlemen are often laughed at, it certainly is a perfect time to be a gentlemen, and you can do it all for free, in this one book.


It also explains some examples of etiquette gone wrong

&gt; In countries where royalty rules the etiquette, it often happens that pride will blind those who make the rules, and the results are often fatal. Believing that the same deference which their rank authorized them to demand, was also due to them as individuals, the result of such an idea was an etiquette as vain and useless as it was absurd.

&gt; For an example I will give an anecdote:

&gt; “The kings of Spain, the proudest and vainest of all{35} kings of the earth, made a rule of etiquette as stupid as it was useless. It was a fault punishable by death to touch the foot of the queen, and the individual who thus offended, no matter under what circumstances, was executed immediately.

&gt; “A young queen of Spain, wife of Charles the Second, was riding on horseback in the midst of her attendants. Suddenly the horse reared and threw the queen from the saddle. Her foot remained in the stirrup, and she was dragged along the ground. An immense crowd stood looking at this spectacle, but no one dared, for his life, to attempt to rescue the poor woman. She would have died, had not two young French officers, ignorant of the stupid law which paralyzed the Spaniards, sprung forward and saved her. One stopped the horse, and whilst he held the bridle, his companion disengaged from its painful position the foot of the young queen, who was, by this time, insensible from fear and the bruises which she had already received. They were instantly arrested, and while the queen was carried on a litter to the palace, her young champions were marched off, accompanied by a strong guard, to prison. The next day, sick and feeble, the queen was obliged to leave her bed, and on her knees before the king, plead for the pardon of the two Frenchmen; and her prayer was only granted upon condition that the audacious foreigners left Spain immediately.”

&gt; There is no country in the world where the absurdities of etiquette are carried to so great a length as in Spain, because there is no nation where the nobility are so{36} proud. The following anecdote, which illustrates this, would seem incredible were it not a historical fact:

&gt; “Philip the Third, king of Spain, was sick, and being able to sit up, was carefully placed in an arm chair which stood opposite to a large fire, when the wood was piled up to an enormous height. The heat soon became intolerable, and the courtiers retired from around the king; but, as the Duke D’Ussede, the fire stirrer for the king, was not present, and as no one else had the right to touch the fire, those present dared not attempt to diminish the heat. The grand chamberlain was also absent, and he alone was authorized to touch the king’s footstool. The poor king, too ill to rise, in vain implored those around him to move his chair, no one dared touch it, and when the grand chamberlain arrived, the king had fainted with the heat, and a few days later he died, literally roasted to death.”

So, I'll admit, this post will be just kind of a vent, but I also want to hear if anyone else has experienced something similar. During my freshmen year of college I spent many hours reading, annotating, and just really digging into a copy of ""IT"" that I'd bought the summer before. It was the first book I've really read non-stop, I mean, for hours on end and hundreds of pages on end. Considering the themes of the book, it was a really neat read as I was right on the crux between being a teenager and an adult. I really got a lot from the book and it was a great experience to read it. I annotate all the books I read because I want to be able to go back and experience them again, what I found in them at that point in my life, how it felt to read them for the first time. Unfortunately, I've been looking for my copy of IT recently and just can't find it. I'm beginning to think I may have left it back in my dorm room at the end of my freshman year - I was so sleep-deprived and exhausted that I ended up leaving an entire painting print (that had great sentimental value, mind you - thankfully I was able to recover that) on the wall when I left, so it certainly isn't out of the realm of possibility. Chances are it's lying around somewhere, but I just will be bummed out if it's not. I'm a pretty sentimental person and I tend to attach feeling to pretty much any old object, and it's probably a vice I should learn to temper, but eh. 

Anyways, this whole thing has got me thinking about why people annotate their books and the attachments people form with them. Why do you annotate your books, or, if you don't, why not? Do you prefer to find old copies with other people's annotations (I like to do this too...)? Do you find that annotating distracts you from the experience of reading or enhances it? I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts about this, and if you have stories about losing books of your own, feel free to share those too.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello book lovers.

Burroughs is a complex novella that explores a man so far outside of society that he wanders through it as though separated by common decency by a screen. This book is semi-autobiographical and follows Lee (Burroughs) as he floats around Mexico and South America in search of sexual conquests and feeding his addictions while suffering heroin withdrawal.

While book may seem tame by modern standards, there are no graphic depictions of sex, the mere fact that this novel openly talks about homosexual relationships made it quite controversial for the 1950s (although not published until the mid 80s). Throughout the novel Burroughs uses many slurs and derogatory descriptions of homosexuals and mexicans. This is not only a sign of the times and attitudes in which the book was written but also the authors complicated feelings of sadness and self loathing.

Queer is more simple than some of Burroughs later work but there are definitely some hints to the strangeness and haunting writing that was ahead of him.

While it is easy to project judgement on Burroughs and his fictional alter ego Lee I think it is missing the point as he has no intention of making his life or any of the stories contained in Queer to be palatable or moral. He isn't seeking out approval, he is documenting his reality. 

I have read Queer many times and this time it really struck me how sadness permiates the work. The surface interpreation of Lee as a predator, and degenerate drug addict is valid but I also really appreciated the underlying sadness, and self hatred that seem to be at Lee's core. This of course to notr absolve or forgive him but it gives me a greater understanding. Lee's seeking of sex is a mask and a cheap way to try and find human connection. As an outsider, he cannot get people to relate to him easily so he turns to sex when he is looking for human companionship


&gt;He put one arm across Allerton's chest and snuggled close to the boy's body. A feeling of deep tenderness flowed out from Lee's body at the warm contact. He snuggled closer and stroked Allerton's shoulder gently. Allerton moved irritably, pushing Lee's arm away.
""Slack off will you, and go to sleep,"" said Allerton. He turned on his side, with his back to Lee. Lee drew his arm back. His whole body contracted with shock. Slowly he put his hand under his cheek. He felt a deep hurt, as though he were bleeding inside. Tears ran down his face.

It was really dark when you look back. Though as a kid i just cared about the progression, you really appreciate how dark it was once you look back on it.

&amp;#x200B;

The series had an interesting enough premise. The book was about kids who could use morphing technology to change into different animals to fight off an alien invasion of slug-like aliens. These slugs were waging a silent invasion on earth in order to capture hosts and take over their brains/bodies. They could be inside anyone, even your mom and dad, who are trapped in their own brain as the Yerk inside them plotted on you next.

&amp;#x200B;

(SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT)

&amp;#x200B;

First... The book was violent and graphic from the start. It featured and was aimed at 13 year olds. Very graphic stories of bodies being torn limb from limb, feeling yourself dying, blood gushing from what was left of your torn body as you slip awayyyy

&amp;#x200B;

But it was so much more then that.  It showed you what can happen in war.

&amp;#x200B;

The kids started off not wanting to be the monsters. They said they wanted to fight them, not become them. But oh, how war can change even a child.  They were 13 when the war started, 16 when it ended.

&amp;#x200B;

At first, they did not want to kill at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Then... They limited it to not killing humans.

&amp;#x200B;

Then it was.  ""We don't kill humans who are running away.""

&amp;#x200B;

Then it was ""We don't kill prisoners""

&amp;#x200B;

Then it was ""We kill all enemies on sight""

&amp;#x200B;

That turned into ""We kill anyone who slows us down, we don't care who they are""

&amp;#x200B;

Then it was ""We do kill prisoners.  In fact, we will black mail you about it"".

&amp;#x200B;

Next. Threats of Mass murder and destruction. Innocents included. Anything or anyone near the target.

&amp;#x200B;

Next. Mass murder and destruction. Innocents included. Anything or anyone near the target.

&amp;#x200B;

Next. Mass murder of helpless prisoners as a distraction. Or.. just because the Animorph leader was having a bad day.

&amp;#x200B;

Next? Send your closest family member to kill your other closest family member. As a distraction. (They both die.)

&amp;#x200B;

Next?  Tell yourself about how you are the good guy, so you would never turn into another human using your morphing powers without their permission.

&amp;#x200B;

Next?  Steal some hospitalized guy's blood from his body so you can use your morphing power to turn into a human without his permission.

&amp;#x200B;

Next?  Woo handicapped children to fight for your guerrilla army. By promising them the power to get out of, and maybe even heal their handicapped bodies, using the morphing process.

&amp;#x200B;

Next? Order the handicapped children to kill a bunch of giant worms. Make the children de-morph exposed in open combat, and flop around helpless in their natural handicapped bodies, in order to turn into dangerous animals to kill almost helpless giant worms who were sentient and mostly slaves themselves, and to themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

Next?  Order the handicapped children to commit suicide via being incinerated one by one. By attacking a powerful flying spaceship as tigers and bears. As a distraction.  (Berate them and peer pressure them when they get scared)

&amp;#x200B;

And lets not forget... Force a ""dog-life-force-giving"" android pacifist with incredible strength and technological ability to assist in killing by threatening to kill as many prisoners as it took. As a distraction.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh... And have most of the main cast most likely die in a suicide attack at the end of the book. Cliff-Hanger.

&amp;#x200B;

(From commentators who refreshed my memory.)

&amp;#x200B;

Also: Convinced a kid to join them as an ally in the war. Trapped him for life as a rat when he could not handle it. Made him beg to die.

&amp;#x200B;

Also: Make allies with a friendly pre-historic earth based alien race. Trick them. Make them go extinct. And take their weapon to save themselves instead.

&amp;#x200B;

Also: Made a kind-hearted pacifist android fall into deep depression by forcing him to live an eternity with the memories of tearing living creatures apart.

....

&amp;#x200B;

Ya...

&amp;#x200B;

The book also discussed numerous social controversies, romance during war, and was a clever read, and made me laugh more then any other book with its humor. It was a heck of a book series.

&amp;#x200B;

Wanted to get to state this book series may have a bit of a ""childish"" writing ideology at the surface, but is a good read, and has great progression of its story and characters. It has a very detailed world. I recommend it.

However, it was considered quite funny by many and was well loved for its cultural niche and time period.

During this time Weir actually wrote his first novel, *Theft of Pride*, which he only published on the internet as far as I can tell.

After Casey &amp; Andy ended Weir went on to do a fantasy webcomic project titled *Cheshire Crossing* about the further adventures of Dorothy Gale, Wendy Darling, and Alice Liddel. It's basically X-men for Victorian children's fantasy and I personally consider it very well written, but unfortunately the art was still extremely mediocre and the comic didn't get very much attention.

I'm starting a buddy reading group for YA Fantasy Books and I'm looking for members! This group is meant to encourage people to keep reading and have discussions every so often about the books.

I'm starting with the Throne of Glass series - a popular series by Sarah J. Maas.

Here's a bit about the first book (from Goodreads):

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After serving out a year of hard labor in the salt mines of Endovier for her crimes, 18-year-old assassin Celaena Sardothien is dragged before the Crown Prince. Prince Dorian offers her her freedom on one condition: she must act as his champion in a competition to find a new royal assassin.  


Her opponents are men-thieves and assassins and warriors from across the empire, each sponsored by a member of the king's council. If she beats her opponents in a series of eliminations, she'll serve the kingdom for four years and then be granted her freedom. Celaena finds her training sessions with the captain of the guard, Westfall, challenging and exhilarating. But she's bored stiff by court life. Things get a little more interesting when the prince starts to show interest in her ... but it's the gruff Captain Westfall who seems to understand her best.  


Then one of the other contestants turns up dead ... quickly followed by another. Can Celaena figure out who the killer is before she becomes a victim? As the young assassin investigates, her search leads her to discover a greater destiny than she could possibly have imagined.

This post is going to be spoiler heavy so if you haven’t read East of Eden yet and you still want to, stop reading now.

This is going to be one big rant but I don’t know any other people irl who have read the book, and I had to air my frustrations somewhere, so I hope you will not find me too insufferable here.

A few years ago I’ve read East of Eden and I was blown away. I fell in love with the characters. I felt that the themes were extremely obvious but somehow it felt beautifully done. The book is so interspersed with these magnificent nuggets of wisdom and reflections on the human condition that I actually felt like I knew a little more about life after having read it.

A few weeks ago I’ve read it again and I’ve been feeling frustrated with it. The reason for it is that as I read it again something stood out to me and the book simply doesn’t seem to realize this, and in fact, almost pretends the opposite of this is the case. So here is my frustration:

Adam Trask is a pitiful loser without any redeeming qualities. There, I’ve said it. Let’s go over some key points in his life story.

He is raised by Cyrus, who blatantly favors him over his brother Charles. This culminates in an episode where a teenage Charles attempts to murder him, after which his father sends him off to join the military. Granted, that’s pretty traumatic and not something he so far could do a whole lot about. 

When he is in the military he ends up exchanging letters with his brother and they end up warming up to each other. He tells his brother he is coming home. Halfway on his way home he decides to reverse his decision and rejoins the military. He never informs his brother until years later, and only contacts him again when he needs Charles to help him out financially. (Hi, I didn’t bother writing to you for years even though you were expecting me to come home but can I borrow $100?)

When he finally returns home they find out their father died and the inheritance is enough to ensure they never have to work another day in their life. Adam consequently never does. 

Cathy comes washing up on their doorstep and Adam is immediately smitten. In the book this is often referred to as love, but it obviously is something different: infatuation. Adam is such a bad judge of character that he can’t see what everybody around him instantly notices: Cathy is the devil. 

Adam decides to move to California. Cathy says she doesn’t want to. He ignores her wishes and forces her to move. He buys a mansion with a large plot of land. Cathy doesn’t want to live there, but he decides that she’ll warm up to it. She never does. After Cathy delivers Charles’ twin baby boys she wants to leave. She is literally forced to shoot him before he lets her go.

For someone who truly loves another, he cares remarkably little about her wishes or even the things she literally tells him.

Adam sinks into a depression and withdraws into a dark hole. He didn’t name his twins for over an entire year, and then only did it because Sam beats the shit out of him. He neglects to care *about* them for 10 more, and even after that, he never *takes care of them* period. After 10 years he suddenly pretends to be their parent. We see this through his conversations with Lee, and he is surprised that they actually have characters of their own. He never actually starts to care about their inner life though. 

Adam gets over his depression by confronting Cathy. In their confrontation he somehow gets the upper hand by telling her that she is missing something. She doesn’t understand love, and he does. Except Adam is utterly incapable of loving anybody. After this confrontation Adam supposed he is cured(*yeah I was depressed for 10 years but I’m certain that after one talk everything will be fine from now*) and he tries to send Lee away as soon as he gets home. Thankfully, Lee declines, because without him everybody would be dead within a week.

Adam has no conception of money or work. He inherits a shit ton of money and lives off of that for the rest of his life. At one point he decides to gamble most of it away on a stupid project that everybody tells him is going to fail. Turns out, it fails, and he requires Lee to tally up the bills to see if he was even able to afford it in the first place.

I find it utterly unbelievable that Aaron and Cal would care about what this weak, absent minded, completely helpless and utterly self absorbed man would think about them. But they do.

In his relationship with his sons he shows blatant favoritism toward Aron. As does everybody except for Lee. Just like as in his relationship with Cathy he completely oblivious to who Aron is. He doesn’t care. In his world Aron is everything that’s good and everything that’s good is Aron. Evidence to the contrary be damned. 

All his imagination about what is bad he projects into his relationship with Cal. In fact the only moment he sort-of connects to Cal is when that idea is confirmed when he has to pick Cal up from the police station. When Cal tries to gain his appreciation by doing what Adam is incapable of, making money, doing something useful, he admonished him and accuses him of stealing it. He basically tells Cal he is an asshole for making money during a war.

Alright, so by now we have a clear picture: Adam is a narcissistic asshole who confuses his obsessions with his imagination of certain people with knowing, caring about and loving those people. He is incapable of doing anything useful, both for himself and others and the one thing in life he actually does fails miserably. 

This is where I get annoyed. Lee is a wise man, understanding, capable. He grasps psychology. He is capable of love. But then Lee reflects upon Adam as follows when talking to Cal:

&gt; I think in him kindness and conscience are so large that they are almost faults.

I’m sorry, what? There must be a hell of a lot happening off screen because there is nothing in the book that would warrant such a statement.
 
He goes on to say:

&gt; He’s not smart in a worldly sense but he’s a good man. Maybe the best man I have ever known.

I’m sorry Lee but you have lost your fucking mind?

I know this book is often at the top of people’s all time favorites, and I used to feel the same. Currently my feelings are a lot more mixed.

He neglects to care &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; them for 10 more, and even after that, he never &lt;em&gt;takes care of them&lt;/em&gt; period. After 10 years he suddenly pretends to be their parent. We see this through his conversations with Lee, and he is surprised that they actually have characters of their own. He never actually starts to care about their inner life though. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adam gets over his depression by confronting Cathy. In their confrontation he somehow gets the upper hand by telling her that she is missing something. She doesn’t understand love, and he does. Except Adam is utterly incapable of loving anybody. After this confrontation Adam supposed he is cured(&lt;em&gt;yeah I was depressed for 10 years but I’m certain that after one talk everything will be fine from now&lt;/em&gt;) and he tries to send Lee away as soon as he gets home. Thankfully, Lee declines, because without him everybody would be dead within a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adam has no conception of money or work. He inherits a shit ton of money and lives off of that for the rest of his life. At one point he decides to gamble most of it away on a stupid project that everybody tells him is going to fail. Turns out, it fails, and he requires Lee to tally up the bills to see if he was even able to afford it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it utterly unbelievable that Aaron and Cal would care about what this weak, absent minded, completely helpless and utterly self absorbed man would think about them. But they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his relationship with his sons he shows blatant favoritism toward Aron. As does everybody except for Lee. Just like as in his relationship with Cathy he completely oblivious to who Aron is. He doesn’t care. In his world Aron is everything that’s good and everything that’s good is Aron. Evidence to the contrary be damned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All his imagination about what is bad he projects into his relationship with Cal. In fact the only moment he sort-of connects to Cal is when that idea is confirmed when he has to pick Cal up from the police station. When Cal tries to gain his appreciation by doing what Adam is incapable of, making money, doing something useful, he admonished him and accuses him of stealing it. He basically tells Cal he is an asshole for making money during a war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, so by now we have a clear picture: Adam is a narcissistic asshole who confuses his obsessions with his imagination of certain people with knowing, caring about and loving those people. He is incapable of doing anything useful, both for himself and others and the one thing in life he actually does fails miserably. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where I get annoyed. Lee is a wise man, understanding, capable. He grasps psychology. He is capable of love. But then Lee reflects upon Adam as follows when talking to Cal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think in him kindness and conscience are so large that they are almost faults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry, what? There must be a hell of a lot happening off screen because there is nothing in the book that would warrant such a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He goes on to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s not smart in a worldly sense but he’s a good man. Maybe the best man I have ever known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry Lee but you have lost your fucking mind?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/rant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this book is often at the top of people’s all time favorites, and I used to feel the same. Currently my feelings are a lot more mixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there anybody who feels the same?&lt;/p&gt;

It's pretty frequently discussed in science fiction circles as it extends into a far greater and wider universe, and even won both a Hugo and a Nebula. 

So I can't help but wonder why this book is so painfully difficult to read.

I don't want to get into a synopsis or finer details of everything that bothered me about it, because that might take more time to type than I have, so I'll keep it more brief. 

Louis Wu, the story's protagonist. 200 years old, but with the health and body of a 30 year-old man. Interesting enough, but what does Niven do with it? Nothing at all, besides use it in a few specific scenarios where he out-wisdoms someone younger and less inexperienced, or comes to ludicrous conclusions through insane jumps of logic that are *ALWAYS* correct. He is sexuality incarnate, and even humanoids of other races find him completely and utterly fuckable, and he finds no moral repercussions in doing just that. I have no qualms with flawed characters, but Louis never changes, and it's never written as though the things Louis does are *bad*, or wrong in any way. He's written to be flawless, and it seems to me like he's Niven's fantasy insert; the man all nerds WISH they could be, sleeping their way through the universe. 

I literally won't even get started on the female characters. And I think the argument ""he's from another time, you have to excuse some of it,"" is complete bullshit. It was the 70's, not the 1800s. Women, even 50 years ago, were viewed as people and not just fleshlights that speak. 

The aliens were so, close to being what Ringworld needed. They don't quite follow Louis's odd trains of thought, and find his practices unusual and often irritating. They're strange and genuinely inhuman, and it's desperately needed to breathe life into the book. Unfortunately, within 50 pages you have already found everything they have to offer. They are flat and static, and immediately become caricatures of themselves. Nessus is calculating and cowardly, and speaker is fierce and proud - but he likes to be scratched behind the ears, and purrs like a cat! How cute, right? 

And my last point: his prose in general. 

Larry Niven somehow managed to consistently make me feel like I was a stupid guy and a bad reader, in two distinct ways.

1. By describing things in ways that were impossible to picture, putting emphasis in strange places, and making unusual features seem mundane. 

2. Describing simple concepts at length like I was reading at a 6th grade level. Repeating things that never needed to be, or hiding inappropriate language, or spelling out every ""revelation"" of the story. 

But the reason all this grated so hard on me is that behind all of this hid a really interesting world, and story that I was truly drawn to. The Ringworld itself holds so much potential, and diving into ideas of determinism clicks on such a deep level. I'm not pissed that I read it, I'm pissed that it could have easily been so much better. 

Through reading this book, I came to the conclusion that it could have been so, so good if Niven had just given the outline to a better writer. 

Anyways, thoughts, opinions?

&amp;#x200B;

I like books about philosophy and I also like self-books. This new book by Edith Hall, a classics professor at King’s College London, looked promising – sitting at the nexus between philosophy and self-help, using Aristotle’s teachings from 2,500 years ago to “change your life” today. To be honest, I had a lot of trouble getting into it – even though I should have been the book’s target audience. 

I think the biggest reason is that the book was too much about Aristotle and not about how to apply Aristotle’s teachings to contemporary problems. Every now and then, the author will throw in a “I can relate to this because I have a problem with vengeance” or a “I have a friend who’s husband could use this advice,” but it’s all very superficial, and not very in-depth. I do agree 100% with the author that we – as individuals, and as a society – could benefit a lot from Aristotelian logic and ethics. But I already knew that going into the book. So, maybe in that sense, I wasn’t a very good candidate for reading this book – because I already agreed with the premise and didn’t really take anything from it. About the midway point, I figured my time was better spent elsewhere and I returned it to my library. 

I still think this could be a fine book for a very specific audience (maybe people who don’t know a lot about Aristotle and would like to learn more), but that’s admittedly not many people.  Other than that, I’m not really sure anyone else would benefit from it.

To help kick off the discussion:

* Who do you think broke into Lady Hardcastle's Room? Why did they take the guns and the page from the day planner? 

* Should Aidan trust Anna as much as he does? Should he trust his own feelings towards her?

* Why do you think Aidan volunteered to come to Blackheath? Do you think he was fully aware of what he was getting into?

* What do you think Stanwin has on Evelyn?

* What do you consider the most suspicious event so far, but you suspect it has nothing to do with solving the mystery?

* Why do you think Evelyn's unsolved murder deserves such an elaborate manner of solution?

Feel free to answer any or all of the questions or tell us what you think of the book so far.

I was thinking the other day when I remembered a game called 'Everybody's gone to the Rapture' which was on a PS4, how good that would have been as a book.

I would love to have known the back stories to these characters and how they came to be where they were. It would also have been fascinating to learn the timeline of events that lead the village to be in the situation it was.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I asked, I'll go first with some of my personal favorites:

1. Lolita (50th Anniversary Edition)

[https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1372767118l/18133.jpg](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1372767118l/18133.jpg)

Like the novel itself, I love how uncomfortable this cover makes me. It's simple on purpose, because the rationale here is all about the context. Just knowing the name of the book, knowing what it's about, completely transforms what would be a pretty ordinary cover into something a lot more uneasy. It makes you feel dirty without doing any overtly perverse, using the infamy of the story to its advantage in order to let the reader essentially creep themselves out. It's a mind-game. Just like the novel.

&amp;#x200B;

2.  1984 (Mass Market Paperback)

[https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348990566l/5470.jpg](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348990566l/5470.jpg)

Okay, so I know that pretty much every single 1984 edition puts the omnipresent eye of Big Brother front and center on the cover (though to be fair, what other opinions are really better?), so why exactly do I prefer this one over the myriad of others? Presentation, I guess. All the other 1984 covers feel too... ominous, I suppose? Too overtly evil. That never really matched with what I really felt was the true terror that made up Big Brother in 1984's first half. It wasn't just the fear that some vague menace could destroy everything you are in one moment, it was that lack of true free-thought. That you really could never be out of Big Bro's eye, anywhere, for the rest of your life. And this simple eye design, almost human looking, always staring, without any sort of overt malice or benevolence, translates that feeling a lot more accurately for me.

&amp;#x200B;

3.  POW! (Seagull Books Hardcover)

[https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1369870252l/15059453.jpg](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1369870252l/15059453.jpg)

I don't really have a lot to say about this one besides that I think it's really damn beautiful. All these different animals illustrated uniquely, surrounding some really slick typography, allowing these wonderful colors to play off each other in order to create one whole theme, it's all pretty mesmerizing. I don't even mind the blurb, because the red of it helps balance out the image even more. I have a pretty mixed opinion on POW! overall, and I know that there isn't any real deeper meaning here, but there doesn't always have to be. It's just pretty. Just meat.

&amp;#x200B;

So please, by all means, share your favorites! I really am looking forward to some of these answers, and the reasons behind them. (If you wish, you can link a book cover by going to its Goodreads page, selecting the Enlarge Cover option, right-click, and select Copy Image Address. Paste that directly in Reddit and you're good to go. If you can't find the edition you want, instead select Other Editions from the Goodreads page, and scroll until you see the one you want. Happy hunting!)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a huge believer that the right cover can really shape an approach or perspective on a novel, I thought I would ask what are some of the best book covers of all time and why.

-

&gt; Mrs. Bancroft’s breasts jiggled with her steps under the thin material of the leotard, and I took a morose interest in the art on the other side of the corridor.

I know it's because the author is trying to portray the though process of the main character, who is obviously focused on this woman's breasts, but it struck me as kind of funny, like ""Then a pair of breasts walked into the room. A head located somewhere above and slightly behind the breasts started saying something or other, which caused the breasts to jiggle a little bit!""

I thought about it and I've noticed that Stephen King sometimes does this too. I remembered when I was reading *Pet Sematary*, thinking it was weird how he kind of randomly started talking about an old woman's breasts:

&gt; It occurred to him that once she had been seventeen, her breasts eyed with great interest by the young men of the neighborhood, all her teeth her own...

Then I wondered how often he talked about breasts in *IT*, so I decided to take a look:

&gt;He struggled halfway up, leaning toward it, and then felt one of Beverly's breasts press against his shoulder as she reached over him to get it.

-

&gt;He stood there for a moment, staring at her as if he had never seen her before. In a way he never had. Her breasts heaved rapidly.

-

&gt;And suddenly—maybe it was because of the utter loathing on her face, the contempt, maybe because she had called him a tub of guts, or maybe only because of the rebellious way her breasts rose and fell—the fear was suffocating him.

-

&gt;It was this latter Beverly who swung the belt for the last time—the belt he had used on her buttocks, her legs, her breasts.

-

&gt;They are in bed together during this conversation. Her breasts are small like peaches, sweet like peaches.

-

&gt;Her hands were folded just below her breasts, as if in prayer.

-

&gt;She clasped her hands together between her budding breasts, fluttered her eyelashes rapidly, and then laughed.

This is where I got bored of this exercise and stopped looking - I was only 30% of the way through!!

So, has anyone else ever noticed this with any authors?

&amp;#x200B;

So, I have recently read The Gutter Prayer by Gareth Hanrahan and, although I am in the very small camp of people that didn't like it overall, it didn't help that the book was in present tense.

&amp;#x200B;

I have read books in present tense and liked them before (The Vagrant by Peter Newman for example), however it took a while for me to get into the flow of it. I find that, when I read present tense books, I read much slower than past tense books, along with feeling lost at times and generally disconnected from the narrative as a whole. All of this hinders my enjoyment of the book.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking to read Wolf Hall, which is in present tense, but I am reluctant to buy it then not get on with it due to it's ""tense choice"".

&amp;#x200B;

Is there something that I am missing? Do you guys have any suggestions as to how I can enjoy/appreciate present tense more? Is it just a case of ""you either love it or you hate it""? I just don't want to miss out on amazing works simply because a character does rather than did.

Baby takes us on a journey as she navigates life in a miriad of seedy apartments with her heroin addicted father. Jules is young (he had Baby at 15), barely educated, addicted, and probably has an undiagnosed mental illness. Jules cannot provide for Baby and wouldn't know how to even if he had the means.

The first person narrative is very effective in this kind of story telling as you are not watching from a far and judging Baby's behaviour. You are privvy to her inner most thoughts and motivations for her actions, which gives you a very clear sense of how a young child in her situation is so poorly equipped to handle the adult world she is living in and how easily exploited a child looking for love and belonging can be.

There are many points throughout the book where Baby has the opportunity to change her situation or to make better decisions but she is often forced back into dangerous by things beyond the ability of a young girl. She is left to have to depend on predators because she cannot turn to or trust anyone else.

Lullabies for little Criminals is riveting, Jules is not a good father, he endangers his daughter constantly either unconciously but also at times deliberately yet I couldn't help but feel that there was real love there.

One day Samuel and his daughter were driving into their new house. And on the way they passed a stranger. That stranger had a tattoo. The tattoo was the shape of a tiger. Extending from the arm up to the shoulder. His eyes brown. His hair black. Which is #000000 in code. By the way. His chin sharp. His body fit. His height tall. The stranger has a wife. Four daughters. Two sons. Seven sisters. And one brother. And also two parents. His occupation is being a bartender. By the way. he also has a scar on his cheek. Also by the way. He has a mole beneath his ear and also on his abdomen. Additionally. The guy had a single hair growing from his armpits. And also one on his toe. Just to let you know. Not to mention the fact that his toenail was black in color. 
*Then proceeds to give a backstory to the stranger*

Yeah... that stranger just happened to never ever appear in the story again... just a passerby. No role in the story or whatever. Just wanted to let you know. Also. Many humans have been talking about something called “Comma”. What the hell is a comma? I’ve never heard of it before. I’ve. Researched. For. Seven. Years. But. Still. Can’t. Find out. What. Commas. Are.

Okay, I totally exaggerated this for laughs, I don’t hate Hannah Tinti. I respect her.

If not, this list likely isn't for you. Enjoyment from, and value of books is subjective.

There are some novels which have stuck with me through the years that are only showing up on the most ecclectic of lists and are snubbed on the top searches. I personally greatly enjoyed these books, and if I were a younger person just going off of what google recommended, I never would've read them and I think that's a shame. I know that your mileage may vary, but here are 5 books that I absolutely recommend to read. Even if it's just fuel for thought.

Shogun by James Clavell.

Dune by Frank Herbert.

Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card (also an author with many interesting other novels if you aren't tied to a genre)

Brave New World by Aldous Huxley (for a prescient past perspective on 'future' [current] times)

Tom Jones by Henry Fielding. I know that liking this book is supposed to be a sign of trash people, and perhaps deep down inside I am. However, Tom is a scamp and a rascal and in today's society of rules and regulations, he is more than a breath of fresh air. He's a re-connection with our roots and a kindling of what brings us joy in life on a primal level.

Edit: The response to this has been roughly what I expected when I made the list. That is the entire reason the list was made in the first place. Not because I wanted criticism, but because that is the typical response to these books. However media has been made about all 5 of them, so clearly SOME people love them, even if it's en-vogue to have the opposite response. That to me just makes a list like this that much more important to post.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I have looked at the common &amp;quot;top&amp;quot; lists of books.

Yet over all these years later, it is still by belief that that his greatest masterpiece is Moneyball, and nearly 20 years later, the book has never been more relevant. 

If we look at the greatest works of narrative non-fiction, the subjects are usually war, politics, or disaster. Yet Moneyball created a thriller like page turner with nothing but math and baseball, hardly the most exciting of combinations. 

Yet Lewis, working with that framework, was able to create an absolute classic of a page turner. The fundamental story was simple, it was man versus environment, the story of how Billy Beane fought against the fundamentally inequalities of baseball, how he was able to be competitive against the rich, mighty Yankees with a fifth of their budget. 

Often Moneyball is dismissed as a baseball book, people who aren't baseball fans often tell me that they avoided the book because they won't understand it or that the topic isn't relevant to them. But that is not true at all, Moneyball is actually about a lot more than baseball, and Lewis, to his credit actually very clearly explained all of the jargon. 

The story of Moneyball is a story of a man, staring into the impossible, but instead of giving up, he started to ask why. Beane realized that he can never win against a wealthy, powerful foe as long as the market conditions that created the fundamental inequality still exists. To win, he had to re-examine how baseball worked, and rethink how things happened. 

Moneyball at it's core was never about on base percentage or slugging average. It was never about the statistics that Beane used at the time. It was about his mentality, the idea of re-examining how things were always done, and trying to figure out if it could be done better. 

Here, Lewis pulls off what the vast majority of non-fiction writers struggle with. Routinely brilliant decisions are written off as a stroke of genius, or, as commonly seen in crime procedurals, they wave their hands and use some techno mumbo jumbo. Instead, Lewis puts you into the mind of Billy Beane, and actually explains the thinking that allowed him to pull off what he did. 

This is what the movie really failed to capture. The film just hand waved away the logic and the thinking behind Beane's sabermetrics influenced plan, and instead had a fat nerdy guy just ""do some computer magic"". 

There's a reason why Moneyball is routinely said to be a management classic, and routinely assigned reading in business schools. Because at the core of it, it isn't a baseball book, or statistics book, but a management book. That's why years after every single market inefficiency mentioned in the book has become outdated, Moneyball is still relevant.

The real story of the Oakland A's isn't the statistics that they used, it is the mindset that allowed them to revolutionize a sport. So yes, I believe Moneyball is one of the finest works if narrative non-fiction I have ever read, and is worth a read even if you don't love baseball, even if you don't love statistics and even if you didn't love the movie.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Lewis is a master of narrative non-fiction, and over the years he has writing great works such as Lier&amp;#39;s Poker, The Blind Side, and The Big Short.

Sci-fi, thriller, mistery etc. just doesn't cut it for me because I care much less about the genre than I do about the feel of the book.

1.

I have no idea what proper names for such categories are. Where can I learn to express these?

2. My second issue is that I can't find a good and quick way to find out these facts about books. I usually have to read several reviews, most of which spoil the plot. (I guess I am thinking something along the lines of how fanfiction is tagged, but I could never really get into reading fan-fiction).

3. My third issue is that sites I found that do recommend books based on books that I like are just totally off base. I read *Quadrail* by Timothy Zahn and liked it so I got *The Fifth Season* by N.K. Jemisin recommended on GoodReads, I'm guessing because they are both sci-fi. I can't imagine two more different books than these.

which lets you use sliders for sad/happy, expected/unpredictable and I really liked the idea, but it is very restrictive, you can only use 4 sliders at a time, and has very few books in their database.

The first 100 pages were fantastic. How they defeated Blane the mono was silly yes, but I enjoyed its silliness. This made me get a copy of The Stand because of the chapters in Topeka. Then the next 200 pages... oh boy. The teenage love story between Roland and Susan almost brought me to a breaking point. However, I kept pushing on because I did feel it was well written. I was so hype when the first part of the flashback was over thinking ""Yes! Back to Roland, Eddie, Susannah, and Jake"" Then I saw it was just an interlude.

The second half of the flashback pulled me right back in. I enjoyed watching the plan come together. By the finale I was devastated by Susan's death. I knew the whole book that she was going to die but the pages leading up to it Roland was so confident that she was going to be safe. When Susan escapes with Olive I was thrilled. When they were caught and Olive pulled out the musket I breathed a quick sigh of relief. Then Susan was captured and was torn apart by Susan realizing this was it. For the first time ever I shed a tear while reading.

For the last portion I thought it was kind of strange that it went in the Wizard of Oz direction. If it wasn't bad enough that Roland lost the love of his life in this book we then learn that he also killed his mother. Made me understand Roland on a whole new level.

I've heard from a lot of people that after The Waste Lands the series goes downhill but for me this series is still going strong. Before moving onto the Wolves of the Calla I'm going to read The Little Sisters of Eluria. 

Long Days and Pleasant Nights.

Right now I'm reading Shogun by James Clavell for the second time. It's set during the year 1600, in Japan, and though the POV swivels to different characters, the main fella is named John Blackthorne (inspired by William Adams, the first Englishman to sail to the Japans). The extreme culture-shock he experiences is excellently articulated by Clavell, and his descriptions of Samurai and the Japanese way of life are beautiful (whether they're historically accurate or not I don't know, but that doesn't really matter to this post).  

Now onto my point.  When I first read Shogun, two years ago, I noticed that my discipline in every day life was changing. More exercise, less junk food; more positive thoughts, less seeing the world as unfair to me; more calm, less worry. Clavell's portrayal of Samurai shows them as extremely disciplined people, devoted to a certain way of living that focused on honor, obedience, politeness, and harmony as pillars of a civilized society. Now, I'm not saying I ever felt inclined to commit ritualistic suicide whenever I messed up, but while the character of Blackthorne was adapting to his surroundings, slowly realizing that the English Protestant way of living had many flaws to it, and adopting the more civilized aspects of Japanese life into his own living, I too started to absorb many of the traits I found admirable about the Samurai and other Japanese (and also about Blackthorne himself).  On my second read of the book, the same thing started happening without me noticing - more exercise, more meditation, better diet etc. etc. I'm not saying the Japanese are perfect in the book, I'm just saying that their positive traits were so well written that they affected me in real life, and I really enjoy the feeling  

Another example would be the influence Atticus from To Kill A Mockingbird had on me. Ever since I read that book, Atticus pops into my mind whenever I notice myself judging anyone unfairly.  His total devotion to non-judgement and being an understanding person will probably be always stronger and more ingrained than mine, but the point is that I judge people a lot less now and am probably better off for it.  

The other big one is Kaladin from the Stormlight Archive book one, who's determination and tireless work ethic really made me dig my heels in whenever I felt like giving up on something.

I’ve never posted on here, I always have just lurked, and I have been in love with books ever since I was around 11. I got a Kindle Fire freshman year and never truly fell in love with it. 

I was adamant that I would only ever read books in print and thought ebooks just “were not my *thing*,” when in reality I just had not used the device I needed. The Kindle Paperwhite has literally changed my life. 

As much as I love to read and always have, I can’t even remember the last time I sat down and truly read before getting this Kindle. It had been at least a year, and anytime before when I would try to read my books in print, I didn’t feel that passion to want to read and indulge in a story. I even used to say I always  loved the idea of an e-reader because you could read in the dark, your hand didn’t cramp as easily, storage of multiple books, etc. Anytime I would try to read, typically at night when I’m off work, I’d struggle to read my paper books unless I had all the lights on to keep me awake. And I of course couldn’t read in bed without a book light. But on the other hand, I hated the glare of the screen outdoors with the Kindle Fire, the feel of the screen, the battery life, distracting apps, etc. 

A friend recommended a Paperwhite the other day, and it blew my mind. I’d been so out of the ebook game, I’d never even heard of it. The idea of a device so closely resembling paper, being glare-free, waterproof, Bluetooth-compatible, compact size, which is easy for travel, and just overall feeling like my dream reading package, has truly inspired me to read again. I tore through the same book I owned in paperback and had been struggling to read in only two days on the Kindle, even with a busy schedule, something I can’t remember the last time I did. I was able to read in the dark, outside, anytime. And I’ve loved every second of it. 

*Long Story Short*

If you haven’t heard of the Kindle Paperwhite and have any doubts about if you would ever like e-books, the PaperWhite may change your mind.

EDIT:

Someone pointed out it’s the E-Ink and backlight that makes me enjoy it so much, which other types of Kindles have. So I guess I’ve learned that that *type * of technology is what has me so excited with never being introduced to it.

So far it is very interesting to compare this Modernist classic the GR, a Postmodernist classic.

When I first read the book I really liked Dedalus but so far on this reread I prefer Bloom because he provides a more solid foundation while Dedalus is drifting through the ether.

Kitchen Confidential – Anthony Bourdain

Synopsis (blurb from the back cover):

""I've been a chef in New York for more than ten years, and, for the decade before that, a dishwasher, a prep drone, a line cook, and a sous-chef. I came into the business when cooks still smoked on the line and wore headbands."" After twenty-five years of 'sex, drugs, bad behaviour and haute cuisine', chef and novelist Anthony Bourdain has decided to tell all. From his first oyster in the Gironde to his lowly position as a dishwasher in a honky tonk fish restaurant in Provincetown (where he first experiences the real delights of being a chef); from the kitchen of the Rainbow Room atop the Rockefeller Center to drug dealers in the East Village, from Tokyo to Paris and back to New York again, Bourdain's tales of the kitchen are as passionate as they are unpredictable, as shocking as they are funny. This unforgettable book will change the way you view restaurants for ever.

Most readers will not need this introduction to Kitchen Confidential – it has sold millions of copies and has been read by a lot of you.  For some reason I’d never read it before now though, but being gifted the book has rectified this error.
**I absolutely loved this book!**  I was a fan of Anthony Bourdain although I’d never read any of his writing and a lot of his TV series passed me by too.  I’ve always appreciated his humanity and curiosity, and I’m glad to report that his personality shines from these pages.  I thought that it shares its style with the likes of Hunter S. Thompson and Ernest Hemingway but although many of the stories are from an aggressive and unreconstructed male environment, you can tell Bourdain is fully aware of this, and contextualises it well.  Kitchen Confidential must have created a hell of a stir when it came out, blowing the lid on the shady practices and chaotic shadows of the commercial culinary world in the late 20th century.

&lt;p&gt;Kitchen Confidential – Anthony Bourdain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synopsis (blurb from the back cover):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve been a chef in New York for more than ten years, and, for the decade before that, a dishwasher, a prep drone, a line cook, and a sous-chef. I came into the business when cooks still smoked on the line and wore headbands.&amp;quot; After twenty-five years of &amp;#39;sex, drugs, bad behaviour and haute cuisine&amp;#39;, chef and novelist Anthony Bourdain has decided to tell all. From his first oyster in the Gironde to his lowly position as a dishwasher in a honky tonk fish restaurant in Provincetown (where he first experiences the real delights of being a chef); from the kitchen of the Rainbow Room atop the Rockefeller Center to drug dealers in the East Village, from Tokyo to Paris and back to New York again, Bourdain&amp;#39;s tales of the kitchen are as passionate as they are unpredictable, as shocking as they are funny. This unforgettable book will change the way you view restaurants for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most readers will not need this introduction to Kitchen Confidential – it has sold millions of copies and has been read by a lot of you.  For some reason I’d never read it before now though, but being gifted the book has rectified this error.
&lt;strong&gt;I absolutely loved this book!&lt;/strong&gt;  I was a fan of Anthony Bourdain although I’d never read any of his writing and a lot of his TV series passed me by too.  I’ve always appreciated his humanity and curiosity, and I’m glad to report that his personality shines from these pages.  I thought that it shares its style with the likes of Hunter S. Thompson and Ernest Hemingway but although many of the stories are from an aggressive and unreconstructed male environment, you can tell Bourdain is fully aware of this, and contextualises it well.  Kitchen Confidential must have created a hell of a stir when it came out, blowing the lid on the shady practices and chaotic shadows of the commercial culinary world in the late 20th century.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to mention Chapter 4 especially – titled “A Day In The Life”.  This chapter is restricted to one typical day working in a kitchen, and is actually one of the longest chapters in the book.  I have never read such an intense, non-stop assault on the senses in my life, and it is worth reading the book for this chapter alone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was left wanting to travel more, to experience life more fully, and to eat.  Eat stuff I would never normally eat, in the company of characters I wouldn’t usually speak to, and to trust in the generosity of others.  The loss of Anthony Bourdain has left the world a less colourful place.  I&amp;#39;ve already started &amp;quot;A Cooks Tour&amp;quot; to keep the Bourdain experience going..&lt;/p&gt;

https://www.taschen.com/pages/en/company/blog/220.revealing_shots.htm

It's a massive box, with the bound book inside. Limited to 1712 copies. The box and the book was larger than the small tables of the cafe.

I didn't make any photos, sorry.

But it's sitting there, waiting for guests to browse while munching on their Croque Madame or the Schnitzel.

We joked about trying to buy it from them for 20 or 25 bucks, but I'm not ruthless enough for that.

So when we paid, we asked the waitress if she knew that they basically had a 1000 CHF book sitting around and they couldn't believe it.

I think I had read a review of this book when it came out, so it kind of rang a bell when I saw it (though I couldn't place it) - and I know that ""Taschen"" specializes in expensive, one-offs with very low number of copies.

But when I looked it up, the price still took me by surprise a bit. I had expected it to be quite expensive, but not a four-digit sum.

Then the staff all moved towards the book-rack and looked at every other book to see if they had another rare edition - it was comical ;-)

I absolutely loved it and borrowed, one at a time, the other ones completely out of order, but I didn't much care about that. So finally the day came when I borrowed Reaper Man. As many other Pratchett-readers I had come to really like the Discworlds Death. And when I like spellbound am reading this book I get towards the end of the book, where Death says one of his best lines to Azrael, just at the end of the right hand page: ""WHAT CAN THE HARVEST HOPE FOR, IF NOT FOR THE CARE OF THE REAPER MAN?""

Ensorceled and with my young heart in my throat I turn the page. And there emblazoned on one whole page is Azraels answer. I still remember the flurry of emotions this moment in this book gave me.

Now we skip a rough decade into the future. I then start to think about reading the Discworld novels chronologically in it's original English. Said and done, I buy the first couple of books in paperback. Not surprisingly I also love them, perhaps even more now that some of the more untranslateable jokes makes sense to me. Some of them I like better others, but I just can't wait to get to Reaper Man again, and finally the day arrives.

So I dig into my newly bought paperback copy of Reaper Man with excitement. I read and read, and finally I come to that remembered place in the novel, just a couple of pages now. I turn a page and my heart sank. There, jumbled in the middle of text, is Azraels answer, badly typeset, with no tension at all.

I finished the book with a lot less enthusiasm than I entered with. I continued to read some more Discworld novels after that, but I lost the momentum. I also discovered that Feet of Clay had some typographical problems in the paperback version that I bought. After reading Hogfather, I went on to other stuff. 

I read later on the internet that this typesetting error had disturbed Pratchett who actually wanted the book in the way that I read it in my native language. 

Maybe it's silly of me, but I just lost momentum and enthusiasm and have not been able to get back to Discworld. I probably will eventually. Silly or not I just wanted to share it, and I wonder if anyone else have had their reading experience spoiled by similar things?

&lt;p&gt;I finished the book with a lot less enthusiasm than I entered with. I continued to read some more Discworld novels after that, but I lost the momentum. I also discovered that Feet of Clay had some typographical problems in the paperback version that I bought. After reading Hogfather, I went on to other stuff. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read later on the internet that this typesetting error had disturbed Pratchett who actually wanted the book in the way that I read it in my native language. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#39;s silly of me, but I just lost momentum and enthusiasm and have not been able to get back to Discworld. I probably will eventually. Silly or not I just wanted to share it, and I wonder if anyone else have had their reading experience spoiled by similar things?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR The bad typography of the English paperback version of Reaper Man made me stop reading the Discworld novels, but I probably will start again sometime in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

It wasn't just the Maya books that were burned. The Aztecs, &gt;Mixtecs, and a few others also had paper documents that &gt;recorded things ranging from history and religious rituals to tax records. From the eight surviving Mixtec codices, we can reconstruct the history of this one valley in Oaxaca going back 800 years. I think we can safely assume that had the other books survived, we would have something approaching a complete history of Mesoamerica at least going back to the Early Postclassic, and in some regions probably earlier.

Put simply, the Spanish book burning is why we talk about Mesoamerica in archaeology classes and not history classes.

So many things happened there, a very stupid game of ""Let's all tell the most shamefull thing each one of the people did.

I am passing by to reccomend the Temptation of St. Antony. It's a wonderfully written book with prose that's extremely evocative in it's wording.

In summary it tells the story of Antony, a monk that's depriving himself of all worldly pleasures in an attempt to reach sainthood, while being haunted by terrible visions of lust, greed and violence, many being born out of his own ego and desires. The descriptions of such visions are written in a ghastly, haunting manner, akin to one's most feverish dreams. One of such presents itself when he meets the tempting vision of the Queen Of Sheba;

""I am not a woman: I am a world! My cloak has only to fall in order that thou mayest discover a succession of mysteries. Do you want the shield of Dgian-ben-Dgian, who built the pyramids? There it is! Upon one side are represented all the wars that have taken place since the invention of weapons; and upon the other, all the wars that will take place until the end of the world.""

Or when his disciple, Hilarion, presents the incongruencies in his interpretations of what pleases God;

""Hypocrite! burying thyself in solitude only in order the more fully to abandon thyself to the indulgence of thy envious desires! What if thou dost deprive thyself of meats, of wine, of warmth, of bath, of slaves, or honours?—dost thou not permit thy imagination to offer thee banquets, perfumes, women, and the applause of multitudes? Thy chastity is but a more subtle form of corruption, and thy contempt of this world is but the impotence of thy hatred against it! Either this it is that makes such as thyself so lugubrious, or else 'tis doubt. The possession of truth giveth joy. Was Jesus sad? Did he not travel in the company of friends, repose beneath the shade of olive trees, enter the house of the publican, drink many cups of wine, pardon the sinning woman, and assuage all sorrows? Thou!—thou hast no pity save for thine own misery! It is like a remorse that gnaws thee, a savage madness that impels thee to repel the caress of a dog or to frown upon the smile of a child.""

The book is filled front-to-back with gems of prose such as the ones I present here. I highly reccomend it to anyone interested in the themes of faith, alienation and nihilism, but it presents itself  as much more than that, also being sort of an account of the many heresies born out Christianity and it's interpretations, along with the philosophical problems of such.

Except, the two last books I tried reading in this genre were total shit: Ken Follett's ""The Pillars of the Earth"" and ""Paris"" by Edward Rutherfurd. I couldn't even read halfway through these books, they were so badly written:

1. The characters explain historical stuff in dialogue, which makes everything seem very artificial. No-one speaks like that! It becomes so clear that the sole purpose of the dialogue is to explain overarching historical concepts to the reader.
2. The characters are under-developed and stupid and irrational. They're cardboard figures. Tom Builder in ""Pillars"" is the most annoyingly stupid piece of shit. Ellen has a ""hot body"", in his opinion. As if anyone spoke like that in the middle ages. Also, according to Tom, Ellen is stuck with ""her weird son"", which is such a stupid description! Also, Tom falls madly in love with Ellen at first sight, and completely forgets that his wife aka ""soulmate"" just died. Wtf? Am I supposed to believe this? Follett basically just states ""She was his soul mate"" when describing their relationship. Ooooh right. I'll just accept that, despite being offered no description what so ever of what their relationship is actually like. All Follett does is just tell, tell, tell, without actually showing anything. And then there's Rutherfurd's ""Paris"", of which I read exactly one chapter before calling it quits. What made me put the book away? The scene where Jacques Le Sourd just suddenly, out of nowhere, tells his mother he wants to kill the son of the man who killed his father. His mother is like ""kool, but be careful and patient"". Ooookay? Just like that, out of the blue? What thoughts went through this Jacques-guy's head when his mother told him about his father's killer? We will never know. All I know is that the author apparently thought KILLING some innocent kid would be a perfectly rational response. DISCLAIMER: I didn't read further because it seemed too stupid. Correct me if I've got this all wrong, if this scene is given a further explanation later in the book. It just doesn't seem like that kind of book to me.

I think historical ficiton is an incredibly complex genre and really difficult to pull off. First of all, you need to convey the historical facts, but also create a story that is plausible and believable. Then you have to weave the two into each other without compromising one or the other. This means you have to explain the historical facts while also making the dialogues natural. This is where a lot of writers struggle. Also, the characters are very easily made into cardboard figures because they're just there to move the plot forwards, and very often they tend to fall into a stereotype without personality: an aristocrat, a nazi, a priest, a princess, etc etc.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I absolutely love history and historical fiction.

I guess I just don't get it?

I don't understand how people so easily overlook the gigantic flaws of this book, or praise the main character so much. For the first 3/4ths of the book I couldn't stand him. He takes advantage of his semi-conscious wife to have sex with her when she's too tired to deny him? How does nobody give a shit about this part? And the way Williams writes about her as if she's some evil witch creates such a lopsided narrative. She obviously had some major problem or trauma with her father, as evident by destroying everything related to him after he passed, and then she basically has to settle for an arranged marriage with someone who couldn't get the hint that she can barely stand him. Williams decides though that she's waging some war against Stoner just because? If you take it as being written from Stoner's perspective it's not any better. It means he's completely oblivious to anybody's experience but his, which doesn't make for a very sympathetic character either.

Williams' writing of women is pretty bad in general. In the affair with Katherine she tells Stoner that when she's with him she feels like ""the slut of the world."" ........ okay? Who the fuck says that? Nobody. Their whole portion reads kind of like some braincel fantasy. He says something along the lines of ""neither of them knew that the pursuit of knowledge and of lust could coincide, let alone heighten each other."" Also, Katherine happens to only have been with one other man, pretty much so it could be explained that Stoner is filling every void that her previous man couldn't.

As far as the whole ""stoic hero"", for the first 200 some pages he is two things, and neither of them are ""stoic."" He's primarily a coward, who doesn't stand up for or against anything except when he's force to make some sort of decision, in which he usually votes to maintain the status quo. Secondly, he's just depressed. There's a difference between someone going stoically through life and playing it cool versus someone who just sits there letting life happen to them. Then in a short part he actually takes any sort of action about anything and makes a power move against Lomax. Cool that's fine, but then he gets cancer. Again he seems a lot less stoic than just depressed, and now drugged as well. 

Pretty much this book is the lame account of a farmboy who has no interpersonal skills, marries the first girl that's been traumatized by her father enough to passively become his wife, doesn't take any action in trying to reach a compromise in the raising of his daughter, cheats on his wife and for some reason doesn't just leave her. Again he lacks communication skills to create some sort of balance in the household. Essentially he just floats through life and takes all kinds of bullshit. That's not stoic, that's cowardly. 

There are some well written parts of the book where I can see people getting caught up. The problem is that this is not a fantastic book with a few flaws, this is a terrible book with a few redeeming qualities.

For everything else that I didn't feel like explaining here, look to the 1 and 2 star reviews on Goodreads. One of the reviews kind of summed it up too, saying something like ""The message of Stoner seems to be that most people live a banal life full of mistakes and misery with some sparse highlights.

The mothers of the main characters (and some of the minor ones) in Jane Austen's novels are all 1. Dead 2. Absent 3. Ineffectual/Fools.  Behold:


*Pride and Prejudice* - Mrs. Bennet - Very much the Fool

*Mansfield Park* - Absent mother, Fanny lives with her Uncle &amp; Aunt, even when staying with her family for a few scenes, we see very little of the mother.  The Aunt is the closest we get, and she is patently ineffective.

*Emma* - Deceased mother

*Persuasion* - Deceased mother

*Northanger Abbey* - Absent mother (?) The only Austen I haven't read, so I'm not 100% sure on this

*Sense and Sensibility* - Mrs. Dashwood - Possibly the least likely to fit this mold, but still an ineffective mother.  She has almost no impact on her daughters lives.  Elinor acts more as the mother to her and her sisters, while Marianne merely does whatever she wants.  No real advice or guidance is forthcoming from Mrs. Dashwood.

Obviously, the worldbuilding is top-notch, it was one of the things that drew me to the books after I heard so many rave about it. The world felt extremely thorough and believable. The magic was great - allomancy, feruchemy, hemalurgy - wonderful ideas executed in a clear way.
The plot was so strong, it's obvious the whole way through that we only understand a fraction of what's happening in the world and why. The mystery of it all was probably the most compelling reason to read it. It's also obvious that B.S. knows exactly where he's going with his story, and I trusted him the whole way through to deliver in the final book, which he did.

That being said, I resented a little how the book talked down to its reader. This seemed to mainly come in the form of excessive repetition of what we already knew; how magic works, the needs and troubles of the characters, the plot points. It felt as though we wouldn't be trusted to remember such complex ideas, and while I understand the need for a refresher throughout a trilogy, I think it could have been done a little more subtly.

I think, if I'm being honest, that the dialogue in these books was maybe the weakest part, it seemed like B.S. was often trying to write what I would call 'banter' among the crew, and I never felt it landed, not in the way that say, Scott Lynch absolutely *nails* in The  Lies Of Locke Lamora. Dialogue is hard to do for a lot of writers because you're walking this line between being believable but not necessarily realistic, and I don't think Mistborn got it right. Vin and Elend's relationship definitely had some nice moments, but overall I felt I was repeatedly told rather than shown what was going on between them. It lacked... emotional depth and perhaps a touch of nuance?  

I felt the character motivations were very well established, too well. So many times I'd end up skimming paragraphs because Vin is worried about who she is, *again*, or Sazed is waxing lyrical on religion, or Elend is questioning his leadership skills. Having character motivations and needs be clear is vital in storytelling of course, but I felt it was overdone here. It got a bit repetitive, even giving the game away in places (for instance I had no doubt that Vin would undoubtedly find her place in the world as a vital part of the story because of her repeated musings on her place in the world.) and I resented a little being told explicitly over and over how the characters were feeling and thinking. I prefer a book that gives me the clues and lets me work it out, dipping into the POVC's brain only occasionally, there were SO many paragraphs that was just what the characters were thinking.

I personally found Elend's transformation from bumbling noble into strong King with the help of the Terris woman perhaps the most satisfying change in the book, and I would have enjoyed Vin's transformation more if she didn't keep explicitly stating how much she had changed in her head.

The second book suffers from middle book syndrome, as others have said. It was a bit slow and the weakest of the trilogy. Once things slowed down a bit I realised I wasn't particularly invested in the characters, and never really felt worried about them dying or not achieving their goals. A lot of the secondary characters felt a little two-dimensional, Kelsier's friend's (I can't recall his name now) death during the siege of Luthadel just came out of nowhere, it felt arbitrary and lacked emotional impact, which was a shame.

The third book was good, tied up everything well, but dragged a little in parts, and felt rushed in others. Personally, I enjoyed the first book the most.

I don't want to shit on the books, I found them inspiring and I'm extremely glad I read them. I'll go on to the Stormlight Archive after I finish rereading The Lies Of Locke Lamora. B.S. is obviously a very talented writer and there's a ton that he got right, I'm wondering how his other books fare in comparison?

I never saw the 1990 version, never read it, never saw the recent film, but just like everyone knows, i knew it was a horror story about a killer clown. In fact, I would bet a lot of people with clown fears still picture that terrifying Tim Curry depiction from 1990, I know I never saw the film but I saw pictures and it downright terrified me.

I finally decided to read “It”, and wow I was blown away. Not perfect by any means, King tends to write a little more than necessary at certain times(one of his charms I suppose) . But it was so much more than some nihilistic horror. This was an epic adventure tale, commenting perfectly on the feeling of growing up, friendship, love, nostalgia, all of that. Like many King novels, it was a book about the struggle between cosmic forces of good and evil. 

I think what I loved most about the story, is that even in spite of the super natural element, it is *so* relatable and taps into that nostalgic point of childhood so much.  I’m only in my 20s, I didn’t play as a kid in the 50s. But I still remembers my 5th grade days riding bikes around the neighborhood, building forts in the creek, meet up at the woods behind our school every day since it was the center of all my friends. I look back on those days now which really seem like such distant memories. Those friendships. That feeling of: you can never be a kid again, but you can still cherish those childhood moments (if you were fortunate to have a good one). 

Really, the book caught me completely off guard. I would love to discuss it.

Side note: Does King have a Richie Tolzier character in every novel?

So here I am, on the fifth anniversary of his passing, going round once more.\n\nOver the next few (or several, or dozen, or who knows how many) months I’ll be publishing thoughts and ramblings on Iain Banks, the Culture novels and their related works. I tend to take a mostly spoiler-free approach when writing about fiction, opting instead to focus more on theme, style, prose, narrative structure, and characterization while keeping recaps to a minimum. There is no shortage of excellent recap and synopsis writing available elsewhere, but I’m much more interested in introducing these books to readers in a way that doesn’t ruin the potential enjoyment of discovery. That being said, in order to discuss certain aspects of Culture novels, I may have to bend my usual rules slightly, but I promise I’ll do everything I can to keep spoilers to a minimum and mark them where applicable.\n\nSo, let’s begin with Banks himself:\n\n \n\n**Caledonian Antisyzygy and the Principle of Charity**\n\nBanks was a highly prolific writer, publishing a total of thirty books over twenty-nine years. He considered himself a science fiction writer, but his creative output was wide, covering also the spectrum of mainstream literary fiction, memoir/travelogue, and a posthumous collection of poetry — his own bundled together with those of his lifelong friend and fellow Scottish science fiction writer Ken MacLeod. As a fierce, outspoken leftist, socialist, and atheist with a quick sardonic wit, Banks was often in the news regarding UK and world politics, particularly regarding Britain’s participation in the West’s post 9/11 involvement in Iraq.\n\nIn his home country of Scotland and the rest of the UK he may be best known for his highly polarizing 1984 debut, The Wasp Factory. A book which famously printed alternating positive and negative blurbs from various publications on its dust jacket and subsequent paperback editions. A brilliant piece of marketing if you ask me. Or possibly it’s his 1992 novel The Crow Road that he’s best known for. It’s an enrapturing and mysterious portrait of a large intertwined familial Scottish community that began with the unforgettable first line: “It was the day my grandmother exploded.”\n\nAlthough his novels have been critically lauded worldwide, none of his mainstream literary fiction, what he referred to as his “hampstead novels”, achieved much measurable popularity in the United States. Here, he’s best known for his Culture series of science fiction novels, and even that work is relatively unknown. Something that is hopefully about to change with the upcoming Amazon Studios adaptation of Consider Phlebas.\n\nAs an American, I regret that Iain Banks wasn’t properly on my radar until he died of gallbladder cancer in 2013, just two months after announcing to the world that he was “officially very poorly”. Since stumbling upon his work I have devoured all but one of his science fiction novels (published under the quite obvious pseudonym of Iain M. Banks) and a handful of his mainstream novels (published without the M).\n\nThere is a certain thread of macabre humor and fascination with the dark corners of human nature that binds most of his work together. He also had a unique internal dialogue of opposing ideas encapsulated in his novels. While doing some research in preparation for this essay, I stumbled upon the concept of antisyzygy, and more specifically what is referred to as Caledonian antisyzygy, or in other words, the Scottish variety.\n\nThe term was first used in 1919 by George Gregory Smith, a Scottish literary critic, in his book Scottish Literature: Character and Influence. He described it as “..a reflection of the contrasts which the Scot shows at every turn, in his political and ecclesiastical history, in his polemical restlessness, in his adaptability, which is another way of saying that he has made allowance for new conditions, in his practical judgement, which is the admission that two sides of the matter have been considered.”\n\nI found this fascinating, mainly because I have never come across a more perfect description of how Banks explores philosophies and ideas in his writing. In her book The Mighty Scot, Maureen M. Martin further elaborates: “Writings by Scots on their country’s national psyche and literature often point to what has been called a ‘Caledonian antisyzygy’ —a conflict between rational and romantic, canny and reckless, moralistic and violent, an idea of dueling polarities within one entity that finds fictional expression..” The revelation that this duality is common not only among Scottish writers, but the Scottish people in general lends credence to the idea that something about the historical, political, religious and social aspects of Scottish life creates this internalized way of dealing with conflict.\n\nI find that Caledonian antisyzygy is deeply entwined in everything Iain Banks wrote. In all of his fiction he spends quite a lot of time chipping away at his own arguments as if they were opposing views, patching and refining them over the course of each book. He does this frequently, and most effectively in his Culture novels, and he’s very, very good at it. As a reader you find yourself unsure of your own opinions by the end of a Banks novel. Instead of an end all solution to whatever question has been posited by the story, you’re left in the wake of the dissonance created by the question itself, with a variety of possible solutions to consider. In 1990, in conversation with the British science fiction writer Michael Cobley he discussed his approach toward writing: “..in fiction the trick is to give people a choice of potential answers so they can disagree with what you’re saying, or what they think you’re saying.”\n\nOffering that option to the reader, to be free to disagree with the message, and still enjoy the book on some level, creates a well rounded experience and speaks to his mastery of the craft. It also gives each story the possibility to resonate on different levels for different readers, not to mention enabling tremendous reread value, and lending towards several different possible interpretations by the same reader when read at different points in their life.\n\nAnother aspect of his writing that’s worth noting, is just how fully he explores the societies or ideas in opposition to his main social ideals as represented by the Culture. He isn’t merely setting up straw men to be easily overcome. This approach reminds me of the Principle of Charity, which states that when in argument with an opponent, argue against the most charitable version of their view. Mainly, assume they’ve come to their argument rationally, and have valid reasons for believing as they do. Only then can you have a meaningful dialogue with someone holding an opposing view to your own.\n\nI’ll be back in the coming weeks to discuss Consider Phlebas, his first published Culture novel, and in my opinion, one of his least understood and most divisive. If you haven’t yet read any Iain Banks, it’s a fantastic time to start. This weekend pick up a Banks novel, preferably a Culture book and spend a little time celebrating his life by getting to know one of the most unique writers of our modern time. The series of books share almost no continuity with one another, so feel free to dig in anywhere. I highly recommend The Player of Games as an easy entry point as well as one of the best in the series.', 'author_fullname': 't2_1loduyyy', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': ""Iain Banks passed away 6 years ago today.

That being said, in order to discuss certain aspects of Culture novels, I may have to bend my usual rules slightly, but I promise I’ll do everything I can to keep spoilers to a minimum and mark them where applicable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, let’s begin with Banks himself:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caledonian Antisyzygy and the Principle of Charity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Banks was a highly prolific writer, publishing a total of thirty books over twenty-nine years. He considered himself a science fiction writer, but his creative output was wide, covering also the spectrum of mainstream literary fiction, memoir/travelogue, and a posthumous collection of poetry — his own bundled together with those of his lifelong friend and fellow Scottish science fiction writer Ken MacLeod. As a fierce, outspoken leftist, socialist, and atheist with a quick sardonic wit, Banks was often in the news regarding UK and world politics, particularly regarding Britain’s participation in the West’s post 9/11 involvement in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In his home country of Scotland and the rest of the UK he may be best known for his highly polarizing 1984 debut, The Wasp Factory. A book which famously printed alternating positive and negative blurbs from various publications on its dust jacket and subsequent paperback editions. A brilliant piece of marketing if you ask me. Or possibly it’s his 1992 novel The Crow Road that he’s best known for. It’s an enrapturing and mysterious portrait of a large intertwined familial Scottish community that began with the unforgettable first line: “It was the day my grandmother exploded.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although his novels have been critically lauded worldwide, none of his mainstream literary fiction, what he referred to as his “hampstead novels”, achieved much measurable popularity in the United States. Here, he’s best known for his Culture series of science fiction novels, and even that work is relatively unknown. Something that is hopefully about to change with the upcoming Amazon Studios adaptation of Consider Phlebas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an American, I regret that Iain Banks wasn’t properly on my radar until he died of gallbladder cancer in 2013, just two months after announcing to the world that he was “officially very poorly”. Since stumbling upon his work I have devoured all but one of his science fiction novels (published under the quite obvious pseudonym of Iain M. Banks) and a handful of his mainstream novels (published without the M).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a certain thread of macabre humor and fascination with the dark corners of human nature that binds most of his work together. He also had a unique internal dialogue of opposing ideas encapsulated in his novels. While doing some research in preparation for this essay, I stumbled upon the concept of antisyzygy, and more specifically what is referred to as Caledonian antisyzygy, or in other words, the Scottish variety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The term was first used in 1919 by George Gregory Smith, a Scottish literary critic, in his book Scottish Literature: Character and Influence. He described it as “..a reflection of the contrasts which the Scot shows at every turn, in his political and ecclesiastical history, in his polemical restlessness, in his adaptability, which is another way of saying that he has made allowance for new conditions, in his practical judgement, which is the admission that two sides of the matter have been considered.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found this fascinating, mainly because I have never come across a more perfect description of how Banks explores philosophies and ideas in his writing. In her book The Mighty Scot, Maureen M. Martin further elaborates: “Writings by Scots on their country’s national psyche and literature often point to what has been called a ‘Caledonian antisyzygy’ —a conflict between rational and romantic, canny and reckless, moralistic and violent, an idea of dueling polarities within one entity that finds fictional expression..” The revelation that this duality is common not only among Scottish writers, but the Scottish people in general lends credence to the idea that something about the historical, political, religious and social aspects of Scottish life creates this internalized way of dealing with conflict.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find that Caledonian antisyzygy is deeply entwined in everything Iain Banks wrote. In all of his fiction he spends quite a lot of time chipping away at his own arguments as if they were opposing views, patching and refining them over the course of each book. He does this frequently, and most effectively in his Culture novels, and he’s very, very good at it. As a reader you find yourself unsure of your own opinions by the end of a Banks novel. Instead of an end all solution to whatever question has been posited by the story, you’re left in the wake of the dissonance created by the question itself, with a variety of possible solutions to consider. In 1990, in conversation with the British science fiction writer Michael Cobley he discussed his approach toward writing: “..in fiction the trick is to give people a choice of potential answers so they can disagree with what you’re saying, or what they think you’re saying.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Offering that option to the reader, to be free to disagree with the message, and still enjoy the book on some level, creates a well rounded experience and speaks to his mastery of the craft. It also gives each story the possibility to resonate on different levels for different readers, not to mention enabling tremendous reread value, and lending towards several different possible interpretations by the same reader when read at different points in their life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of his writing that’s worth noting, is just how fully he explores the societies or ideas in opposition to his main social ideals as represented by the Culture. He isn’t merely setting up straw men to be easily overcome. This approach reminds me of the Principle of Charity, which states that when in argument with an opponent, argue against the most charitable version of their view. Mainly, assume they’ve come to their argument rationally, and have valid reasons for believing as they do. Only then can you have a meaningful dialogue with someone holding an opposing view to your own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ll be back in the coming weeks to discuss Consider Phlebas, his first published Culture novel, and in my opinion, one of his least understood and most divisive. If you haven’t yet read any Iain Banks, it’s a fantastic time to start. This weekend pick up a Banks novel, preferably a Culture book and spend a little time celebrating his life by getting to know one of the most unique writers of our modern time. The series of books share almost no continuity with one another, so feel free to dig in anywhere. I highly recommend The Player of Games as an easy entry point as well as one of the best in the series.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None,

Jim poured himself a glass of whisky, sighed about his ex girlfriend, and said ""remember when we were younger, and we dreamed of being rockstars? I always dreamed of having as much Hennessy as I want while having lots of sex with lots of groupies"". 

Ignoring the fact that Jim is utterly terrible at guitar, his dream isn't exactly an uncommon one. Millions of kids around the world idolize rockstars, and the live fast, die young lifestyle surely has it's draws. 

Now every day when you turn on the news, what do you see? You see political upheaval, violence, suffering, unemployment. In the World State? There is none of that, society is peaceful, humming along nicely. Hell, as a terribly student, they even fixed the education problem, by teaching people in their sleep!

Let's look at the positives of World State? World peace, political stability, no torturous years in school, lots of sex, lots of drugs, live fast, die young. Sounds like a pretty damned good Utopia to me!

So what is allegedly wrong with World State? People have no agency, You are born into a caste at birth, and there is no way out of it. People are spiritually empty, that materialism cannot solve all of their problems. 

At the end of the day, Brave New World is a republican nightmare, but a monarchist dream. Consider the great divide between monarchist and republican thinking:

In traditional monarchist ideology, there is a natural order of things. Kings rule with divine right and people know their lot in life. As Confucius argued, the ideal state is stratified but organized, where everyone knows their place, and the ruler rules well. 

This is in contrast with the republican ideal of agency, where one should have a right to decide their place in life. Remember, the rallying cry of the American revolution was ""no taxation without representation"", not ""we want lower taxes"". It was also ""give me liberty or give me death"" not ""give me prosperity or give me death"". 

A state where everyone gets their needs taken care of, where there is a rigid social order is the monarchist dream. But it is fundamentally the antithesis of the republican idea. 

But here's the thing though, republicans believe in the idea of ""the pursuit of happiness"" as a fundamental right. But in World State people literally have chemicals to give them happiness, they have been given peace. 

There is this idea in politics of the ""temporarily embarrassed millionaire"", that it is possible to have poor people support policies that benefit the rich by convincing them that they too, can be rich, and that they're just temporarily poor. But is that not the idea that Brave New World is trying to exploit? That although you are unhappy, struggling to get by, that despite the fact you work an unfulfilling job and are suffering from crippling loneliness, that you should view a state that gives everyone everything but spiritual fufillment and social advancement as a distopia. Because one day, just one day you might be able to improve your station in life? 

We live in a world where millions of people die to war and conflict. Millions more live in crippling poverty. Anti-depressant use is spiraling out of control, and suicide is one of the leading causes of death. So just how bad is World State anyways? And you'll be giving up is the miniscule possibility of spiritual fufillment and the tiny chance they you can rise above your station in life. 

Statistically speaking, the vast majority of the world does not exceed the station of their birth through luck and hard work. Statistically speaking, almost nobody achieves spiritual fufillment. So therefore, statistically speaking, Brave New World should be a Utopia. Peace on Earth and economic prosperity as a trade for the miniscule chance of social advancement? Statistically you should make that choice.

On one level I liked *Carry On* a lot. Although the characters and worldbuilding are very heavily Harry-Potter-influenced they are also distinctly different in such a way that they can be appreciated on their own merits and don't need to be directly compared as better or worse.

On another level, though, I feel kind of more ambivalent about it, and that's directly related to how it originates out of fandom culture and the Harry Potter fandom in particular.

And despite the differences between Harry Potter and *Carry On*, they are still similar enough that *Carry On* could easily be read as a commentary on Harry Potter or even a how-it-should-have-been fixit kind of thing – hell, at one point [](#s ""the Mage"") even rants ""[](#s ""What is the greater good?"")"", which is way too on the nose for my taste – and if that *was* the intention behind it, then I disagree with it completely.

I think people expect the difference to be one of the following:

1. Elitism: The idea that some texts are worthy, and some texts are not. So, the difference between studying at the university level versus at the fan level is one of content (e.g. “There is a difference between studying the classics and some silly T.V. show”).
2. Author Knowledge: The idea that my studies consist of looking into the fine details of an author’s life in order to understand the inspirations that led to a particular work of genius. (e.g. “Jane Austin had purple curtains in her childhood bedroom, and this was her inspiration for the way purple is used in this scene”).

Both of these assumptions are incorrect, but understandable.

Elitism has been a part of University entrance and attendance from the beginning. We have since decided that University entrance should be based on ability instead of class. It should be that way, but as the recent controversy over entrance bribes shows, that is not sadly not the reality. Some people assume that because I am part of the University, my professional attitudes must be elitist as well.

People assume I sieve the good work from the bad based on examples of great literature like Hamlet. I would never argue that Hamlet is not great literature, but I would argue that it is a tiny biased template of what literature can be and do. Yes, I have studied Hamlet. I have also studied Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand by the brilliant Samuel Delany. If you are sieving for more things exactly like Hamlet, you will miss this novel and so many others.

You might find yourself wondering, as I did during my studies: how do you know if something is good literature if it isn’t a classic? After all, isn’t what you enjoy in books a matter of personal taste? If it is just a matter of taste, someone who really likes Game of Thrones and does a lot of online analysis about it in their spare time appears to be doing the same thing I do.

The simple truth is, those hobbyists *are* engaged in the same activity that I do for a living, just at a smaller scale and with less knowledge than I have about studying literature (not about Game of Thrones – I assume there are many people who know more about the show/books than I do).

This leads us to the second idea, Author Knowledge, which has logic that works like this: if hobbyists are doing what I do, but have less knowledge, that knowledge must be about “what the story really means” which is knowledge that comes from the author (who obviously knows their own story best). Therefore, knowing the most about the author must mean that you also know the most about what the story “really means.”

Insanely long edit:

&amp;#x200B;

This post very unexpectedly blew up. If I had realized it was going to reach so many people I would have been more careful in the framing of this post, and included the fact that I fall into the ""death of the author"" camp (read Barthes if you're interested), which is a common but by no means universally agreed upon in my field.

&amp;#x200B;

To the people who are asking for recommendations at improving their skills at literary/textual analysis:

 

The first step is to find your interests.

Classics really interest some people because they enjoy the research involved with understanding particular things properly. Other people would rather cut off a finger with pruning sheers than read the unabridged Moby Dick and be held accountable for knowing and understanding every single detail of it.

If you're in the pruning category, avoid any classics that would require research you wouldn't enjoy, such as the entire process of rendering lamp oil, from the techniques of whale hunting, to the slaughter and processing and storage of the blubber as it becomes oil, and the particular specifications of the ship which is required to both hunt effectively and render efficiently.

Read things in the genre you like that are more difficult than what you're reading now. There are a ton of book clubs and sites like goodreads that can help give you specific recommendations. As you read, ""engage critically"" (i.e. ask questions), think about what the story is about and how it works and how you are supposed to feel about certain parts of the book. If the book is pushing you to feel a certain way about a character's decision, ask why. Theorize. Then find people to run your theory by. Then read, theorize, bounce your ideas off knowledgeable people again, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

To the people who are asking ""so what IS the difference between what you do and GoT fans do?""

&amp;#x200B;

I'd say about 80% of it is exactly the same.

&amp;#x200B;

I shouldn't have used GoT as an example because I'm not that familiar with it. Let's use The Catcher in the Rye.

People hate this novel. There is a popular opinion which has been attributed to literary theorists that this novel is not worth reading because it's just a bunch of whiny wealthy white guy problems passing off as art.

People (humanities academics included) have taken issue with how the novel is being taught in US high schools because it so often gets taught as a lesson on universal feelings as a person comes of age. It is a coming of age story, but it's not universally applicable. Holden has the reactions he does because of who he is. The whole book is about who he is and how and why he can't trust people ""phonies"" which includes the fact that he is wealthy, white, male, and educated. It's a different coming of age experience than you find in The House on Mango Street or The Absolutely True Diary of a Part Time Indian. They're all great coming of age novels, but the differences matter, and none of it is entirely universal.

People sometimes hear this and respond ""so white male experience doesn't matter?"" (of course it matters, it just doesn't inherently matter more than any other experience). 

People sometimes hear this and respond ""all critics do is complain and ruin perfectly good things!"" (if you believe that entertainment and media companies/publishers are neutral purveyors of neutral content that shouldn't be questioned, I don't know how to convince you otherwise).

The difference in my work and the work of someone outside of academics has a lot to do with access, and some to do with training. Through my university library I have access to literally millions of peer reviewed sources from pretty much every subject that has been studied since about the 1960's. Through my universities particular archives and museum, I have access to even more primary source material that is unavailable to the public. I can look up the office hours and email of any professor on campus and ask for a 30 minute interview about whatever subject I need to know more about (the History department is great for tackling Moby Dick). I have an incredible amount of access to expert knowledge and to experts themselves. That access and training I would say accounts for most of that difference.

The price I pay for that access is... well, if you're read up on tuition spikes and the adjunct crisis you already know.

&amp;#x200B;

To the people who want to insist that the author HAS to be the final authority on the meaning of their own work:

&amp;#x200B;

Stephanie Meyer wrote the Twilight series. It was hugely popular, revived the economy of a small town in the pacific northwest, got turned into movies, merchandise everywhere, die-hard fans. That makes in an important piece of literature.

It is very popular, but when you analyze the texts (books and films), and the contexts (the audience, the fanfiction, the clubs, the reviews, and, of course, the author, etc.), there are certain conclusions you can draw based on that data. Those conclusions and all relevant knowledge go through an extensive process of peer review before they are published.

One common academic interpretation of the series is that the main female character, Bella, has very little agency and therefore is not a ""feminist hero"" as some people were claiming (just because the main character is female, that doesn't mean it's a feminist book). Not every book has to be or should be a primarily feminist text. Besides, it's not a moral argument. The argument is just that these texts don't belong in this category based on the available data.

Stephanie Meyer says the book does belong in that category, and that it is a feminist book. She even wrote a wildly unpopular rewrite of the first novel in which she gender swapped the characters to prove that Bella's gender didn't effect the text, and it would be just as natural and good a story if all the characters swapped sex/genders. It's called Life and Death: Twilight Reimagined, and it's quite an experience.

If the author controls the interpretation of their own text, then Stephanie Meyer is right, and Twilight has by this action been irrefutably proven to be a feminist text.

I disagree. One of the very important tropes of the series is that Bella is either destined or fated to be with Edward. From that point she can either go with fate or work against it. Edward is the one who works against the fate he literally sees in his psychic sister's head due to his mind reading abilities. He chooses to work against fate to try to change it but eventually accepts it and decides fate (cough God cough) knows what it's doing and then Bella is happy because she always liked and wanted the life that fate laid out for her. In my opinion, that doesn't belong in the ""feminist plot"" box (again, not a moral judgement, not saying liking it means you hate women, I obviously enjoy the series enough to know this much about it). It just doesn't belong in that particular box because it has a disqualifying feature.

If the author is in control of the interpretation of their text, it goes in the box anyway because they chose their own qualifying and disqualifying features. I believe the conversation is better and more useful and productive if at a certain point we can agree that an author only has a limited input into the conversation about their text.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m a PhD student in English Literature (literature written in the English language, not Brit Lit), and I get asked “how do you know the author meant that” so often that I am writing this explanation down and hoping that it helps people who legitimately don’t get the difference between what I do and what people obsessing about the ending of Game of Thrones do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think people expect the difference to be one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elitism: The idea that some texts are worthy, and some texts are not. So, the difference between studying at the university level versus at the fan level is one of content (e.g. “There is a difference between studying the classics and some silly T.V. show”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Author Knowledge: The idea that my studies consist of looking into the fine details of an author’s life in order to understand the inspirations that led to a particular work of genius. (e.g. “Jane Austin had purple curtains in her childhood bedroom, and this was her inspiration for the way purple is used in this scene”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these assumptions are incorrect, but understandable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elitism has been a part of University entrance and attendance from the beginning. We have since decided that University entrance should be based on ability instead of class. It should be that way, but as the recent controversy over entrance bribes shows, that is not sadly not the reality. Some people assume that because I am part of the University, my professional attitudes must be elitist as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People assume I sieve the good work from the bad based on examples of great literature like Hamlet. I would never argue that Hamlet is not great literature, but I would argue that it is a tiny biased template of what literature can be and do. Yes, I have studied Hamlet. I have also studied Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand by the brilliant Samuel Delany. If you are sieving for more things exactly like Hamlet, you will miss this novel and so many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might find yourself wondering, as I did during my studies: how do you know if something is good literature if it isn’t a classic? After all, isn’t what you enjoy in books a matter of personal taste? If it is just a matter of taste, someone who really likes Game of Thrones and does a lot of online analysis about it in their spare time appears to be doing the same thing I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simple truth is, those hobbyists &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; engaged in the same activity that I do for a living, just at a smaller scale and with less knowledge than I have about studying literature (not about Game of Thrones – I assume there are many people who know more about the show/books than I do).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads us to the second idea, Author Knowledge, which has logic that works like this: if hobbyists are doing what I do, but have less knowledge, that knowledge must be about “what the story really means” which is knowledge that comes from the author (who obviously knows their own story best). Therefore, knowing the most about the author must mean that you also know the most about what the story “really means.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insanely long edit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post very unexpectedly blew up. If I had realized it was going to reach so many people I would have been more careful in the framing of this post, and included the fact that I fall into the &amp;quot;death of the author&amp;quot; camp (read Barthes if you&amp;#39;re interested), which is a common but by no means universally agreed upon in my field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the people who are asking for recommendations at improving their skills at literary/textual analysis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to find your interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classics really interest some people because they enjoy the research involved with understanding particular things properly. Other people would rather cut off a finger with pruning sheers than read the unabridged Moby Dick and be held accountable for knowing and understanding every single detail of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re in the pruning category, avoid any classics that would require research you wouldn&amp;#39;t enjoy, such as the entire process of rendering lamp oil, from the techniques of whale hunting, to the slaughter and processing and storage of the blubber as it becomes oil, and the particular specifications of the ship which is required to both hunt effectively and render efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read things in the genre you like that are more difficult than what you&amp;#39;re reading now. There are a ton of book clubs and sites like goodreads that can help give you specific recommendations. As you read, &amp;quot;engage critically&amp;quot; (i.e. ask questions), think about what the story is about and how it works and how you are supposed to feel about certain parts of the book. If the book is pushing you to feel a certain way about a character&amp;#39;s decision, ask why. Theorize. Then find people to run your theory by. Then read, theorize, bounce your ideas off knowledgeable people again, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the people who are asking &amp;quot;so what IS the difference between what you do and GoT fans do?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d say about 80% of it is exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shouldn&amp;#39;t have used GoT as an example because I&amp;#39;m not that familiar with it. Let&amp;#39;s use The Catcher in the Rye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People hate this novel. There is a popular opinion which has been attributed to literary theorists that this novel is not worth reading because it&amp;#39;s just a bunch of whiny wealthy white guy problems passing off as art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People (humanities academics included) have taken issue with how the novel is being taught in US high schools because it so often gets taught as a lesson on universal feelings as a person comes of age. It is a coming of age story, but it&amp;#39;s not universally applicable. Holden has the reactions he does because of who he is. The whole book is about who he is and how and why he can&amp;#39;t trust people &amp;quot;phonies&amp;quot; which includes the fact that he is wealthy, white, male, and educated. It&amp;#39;s a different coming of age experience than you find in The House on Mango Street or The Absolutely True Diary of a Part Time Indian. They&amp;#39;re all great coming of age novels, but the differences matter, and none of it is entirely universal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People sometimes hear this and respond &amp;quot;so white male experience doesn&amp;#39;t matter?&amp;quot; (of course it matters, it just doesn&amp;#39;t inherently matter more than any other experience). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People sometimes hear this and respond &amp;quot;all critics do is complain and ruin perfectly good things!&amp;quot; (if you believe that entertainment and media companies/publishers are neutral purveyors of neutral content that shouldn&amp;#39;t be questioned, I don&amp;#39;t know how to convince you otherwise).&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I don't remember much from my childhood, but I do remember that I read an absolute shit ton. As a kid, I was fairly shy and quiet, and I had my own fair share of bullies. But I was able to escape all of that through a good book or two. I would start a book one day and finish it by the end of the next day, immediately searching for possible sequels or replacements. I read fast and I read furiously. 

&amp;#x200B;

As time went on, I started getting involved in other things. I tried a variety of extracurricular activities throughout elementary and middle school, ranging from basketball and track to music and computers. Once I entered high school, I found my niche, the place where I felt like I belonged. I also got much more involved, and I joined two handfuls of groups and societies with the intention of building a resume up for college applications.

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate side of this story is that I had no time to myself. I couldn't read anymore than what I was already reading for my classes. There was just no time. Something had to give, and I unfortunately chose reading for fun. Four years pass and I'm suddenly graduating. I basically got my wish: admission, scholarships, awards, etc. I had worked hard for all of these things, and I felt that I was ending on a high note. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everything came crashing down in college.

&amp;#x200B;

Without going into too much detail, I felt like I was completely drowning. I dropped out and took some time to myself, tried to get some help. I got that help, but it really didn't do much. I returned to college, as I needed to keep my scholarship, and that required me to get my grades back up. I would spend the next 3 years struggling every second of every day, just doing my damndest to get by and keep that scholarship. I lost it for my fourth year by .02 GPA.

&amp;#x200B;

Flash forward to a month or two ago. I was having a really bad night, and I found myself laying in bed at 3 AM in disarray. For whatever reason, my eyes got caught on this book in my room. I had asked for this book a couple years ago, but I basically just added it to my collection of memorabilia. I knew that the book was dark, that it was gonna take me down a very difficult path, but I was desperate for something. I picked it up and started reading through the first couple pages.

&amp;#x200B;

By the end of the next day, I had finished all 250 pages of it (the font was pretty big, so it was probably more like 200). And I felt completely cathartic. It felt like I was a kid again, like the hell that followed my childhood was some distant future I wouldn't have to face. I no longer felt like the lost kid looking for a place to belong. I felt happy once again.

&amp;#x200B;

I stopped off at Barnes and Noble the other day to look for a book I had heard about recently. It was a long-ass book, and I've already finished half of it in a week. That's more reading for fun than I've done in the past 6 years alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

All this to say that reading has changed my life. And I'm thankful that I've found reading once again.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without going into too much detail, I felt like I was completely drowning. I dropped out and took some time to myself, tried to get some help. I got that help, but it really didn&amp;#39;t do much. I returned to college, as I needed to keep my scholarship, and that required me to get my grades back up. I would spend the next 3 years struggling every second of every day, just doing my damndest to get by and keep that scholarship. I lost it for my fourth year by .02 GPA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flash forward to a month or two ago. I was having a really bad night, and I found myself laying in bed at 3 AM in disarray. For whatever reason, my eyes got caught on this book in my room. I had asked for this book a couple years ago, but I basically just added it to my collection of memorabilia. I knew that the book was dark, that it was gonna take me down a very difficult path, but I was desperate for something. I picked it up and started reading through the first couple pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the next day, I had finished all 250 pages of it (the font was pretty big, so it was probably more like 200). And I felt completely cathartic. It felt like I was a kid again, like the hell that followed my childhood was some distant future I wouldn&amp;#39;t have to face. I no longer felt like the lost kid looking for a place to belong. I felt happy once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped off at Barnes and Noble the other day to look for a book I had heard about recently. It was a long-ass book, and I&amp;#39;ve already finished half of it in a week. That&amp;#39;s more reading for fun than I&amp;#39;ve done in the past 6 years alone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this to say that reading has changed my life. And I&amp;#39;m thankful that I&amp;#39;ve found reading once again.&lt;/p&gt;

A number of questions come buzzing immediately on my drunken wits, being so doused in the very liquid of Shakespeare's intoxicating language. Was the assassination justified? To what extent was Cassius a bad man? Was Antony Machiavellian or an honorable hero? Was the puissant Cæsar truly good? To what extent did green envy play a role in the killing? 

The characters were wonderful. O! Noble Brutus! To die so on a Roman sword, in mighty honor's graces! And the suicide of dear harmless Portia left me stricken to the core. When Brutus beseeches the gods to make him worthy of such a noble wife, he was speaking from the heart. But in the end she commits suicide, being unable to take the stress of the situation. 

What else stands singular to me, is the character of Cassius. Was he truly a bad person, a psychopath, or an envy-filled man? For, certainly, he has many faults. But what about all the good things he does? Comforting Brutus genuinely after the argument in the tent? Committing loyally to the enterprise subsequent to the monstrous assassination? Fighting to the end, even choosing to die by suicide? No, I cannot think such a man wholly dishonorable. He had some redeeming virtue yet within his heart.  

And in the likewise, Antony had some dishonorable stain upon his (ostensibly) untarnished character. More specifically, in IV.1, he conspires to deprive Lepidus of his right to be a ruler alongside Antony and Octavius. He scorns him secretly, calling him a man fit to be sent on errands. Yet Lepidus, from what little we see of him, appears true and just, not to mention, as Octavius does, a valiant soldier. Antony shows him disrespect, intending to deprive him of his place in the triumvirate. 

My brain turns from the standard reading of ""Antony + Octavius = good"" and ""Brutus + Cassius + Cimber + Casca + etc = bad"". I believe there is far more complexity here that Shakespeare is letting on. And I haven't even addressed the part where Antony rouses the crowd with emotion, marshaling his oratory to exploit their worst aspects. He unleashes a hailstorm upon Rome. Was this one man, this Cæsar, worth the carnage and the veritable destruction of masses of people? Antony seems to imply so. In his speech where he drops the famous line ""Cry havoc!"", he says that the world will turn so bloody and dreadful that mothers will smile when they see their children die because it will become the custom of the time. It is almost as if Antony is fantasizing about vengeance, and in the process doesn't care about innocent people.

I have already shared my overall thoughts on my podcast but I am looking to get some other opinions to see what the general consensus is. Thank you for your time.

His website has the following description: [http://www.stevenstrogatz.com/books/infinite-powers](http://www.stevenstrogatz.com/books/infinite-powers)

""Though many of us were scared away from this essential, engrossing subject in high school and college, Steven Strogatz’s brilliantly creative, down to earth history shows that calculus is not about complexity; it’s about simplicity. It harnesses an unreal number—infinity—to tackle real world problems, breaking them down into easier ones and then reassembling the answers into solutions that feel miraculous.

&amp;#x200B;

Infinite Powers recounts how calculus tantalized and thrilled its inventors, starting with its first glimmers in ancient Greece and bringing us right up to the discovery of gravitational waves (a phenomenon predicted by calculus). Strogatz reveals how this form of math rose to the challenges of each age: how to determine the area of a circle with only sand and a stick; how to explain why Mars goes “backwards” sometimes; how to make electricity with magnets; how to ensure your rocket doesn’t miss the moon; how to turn the tide in the fight against AIDS.""

&amp;#x200B;

Excerpts from my thoughts:

Infinite Powers is an excellent book about the history of calculus. It begins in ancient Egypt and ends in the realm of quantum mechanics. All along the timeline Strogatz gives examples on how calculus was used at that particular snapshot in time. This ranges from the basics of determining the area of a circle to using Fourier series to predict events ranging from how air flows over a plane wing to the flow of blood through an artery.

This book really gave me a better understanding of where calculus came from and why it was needed. I took several calculus courses in college. I went from calculus one through differential equations and learned how to handle those types of equations. I learned how to perform all these calculations and formula manipulations but it was all very template like to me. I knew how to do certain operations but I didn’t know why I was doing them or how to get to them in a real life application.

Now that I have read through the book I have a better understanding of the reasons behind the formulas. This small bit of insight has given me the broad overview that I now realize I needed. I have always been sort of cloudy on the real meaning behind the formulas when I read them in books. I knew how to find the derivative but not really what it meant or why I would be interested in it. 

One of the main things that helped me get a grasp of how the formulas I deal with actually work was the explanation of infinitesimals. Hard word for me to say, but very helpful nonetheless. Strogatz explains them as the tiniest number that you can possibly imagine that isn’t quite zero. It’s smaller than everything but bigger than nothing. Strangely you can have some that are larger than others. So it’s the smallest thing you can think of, but there are also some that is smaller than that. A strange concept to be sure, but in the end it allows you to decide what you can ignore to only concentrate on the parts that contribute to the answer in a meaningful way.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was my first book by Strogatz and I am amazed at how he can explain calculus in such an engaging way.&lt;/p&gt;

There is one quote I've been desperately searching for to no effect. I believe it is from one of Hippolite's rants at the villa in Pavlovsk. What Hippolite says there is that knowing he will be dead in a couple of weeks he cannot comprehend how every healthy person in the world doesn't end up amassing great riches and achieving every thing they want in life.  


Any help is much appreciated, also if you think I'm crazy and there is no such thing in the novel, please speak up.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Dostoyevsky junkies,  &lt;/p&gt;

While most people prefer *Red Dragon*, *Hannibal* is the book that actually continues to give me nightmares. Harris' prose is incredibly sparse and deliberately composed to feel disassociated, detached &amp; uncaring. *Hannibal* is an alienating experience - horrific and gruesome. In the novel, he introduces Mason Verger.

Mason is a character that actually gave me nightmares when I first encountered his satanic form all those years ago. Mason continues to give me nightmares to this day, he's completely deranged, damaged, awful, wicked, inhuman, cruel, grotesque, and absolutely evil. Understanding the Verger dynasty as a metaphor for the cannabilistic and perverse elite of our lived-in world, *Hannibal* can also be viewed as a radical book. Mason Verger as the divine capitalist, as the demonic arbiter of judgement within that sociopathic system, is a layer that never ceases to floor me. 

I normally read this novel once a year and this year is no different but it is special considering it is its 20th birthday. I think it's one of the scariest novels ever written, if not the scariest one ever. Starling's alienation, Krendler's psychosexual humiliations, Mason's sick perversions and sadistic impulses, Pazzi's predestined doom, and, of course, Dr Lecter's own visceral philosophy elevates *Hannibal* into the realm of legendary in my eyes. 

Seriously - just thinking about Mason Verger is enough to petrify me forever. His deformities, his psychopathy, his morbid sexual appetites, his appalling history, his obsession, his pigs, and his torture methods are enough to send me reeling with fright. He is certainly one of the scariest characters that I've ever spent time with, that I have ever read about, and I'm not lying about the nightmares. Even my waking life is plagued with shivers every time Mason enters the page. I love feeling scared. Mason scares me and I love it.

On a lighter note, the book makes me want to visit Florence. I have saved on my phone at least a dozen pictures of Florence and Thomas Harris makes it come alive through the absurdly cursed Pazzi and with his storytelling. It seems like a tragicomic and beautiful historic city beaming with Gothic myth. Due to its place of import in the novel, I have come to desperately want to visit Florence one day and hopefully I will.

I hope others are revisiting *Hannibal* and are gladly celebrating its 20th Birthday.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, this is a weird thread, I know, but for quite a few years now, *Life of Pi* (Yann Martel) has been one of my favorite books, and it gets under my nerves when people misinterpret the ending. From blogs discussing the book to the actual goddamn movie, people CONSTANTLY talk about how the ""big twist"" of the book is that the animals aren't real at all--completely missing the point of the book: you get to choose what you believe in.

&amp;#x200B;

This message is *why* this book is my favorite, because as Pi lays out clearly: so long as the outcome is the same, why does it matter what the ""truth"" is? Choose whichever story brings you more peace/makes you happier in life. The whole point of the novel is that we don't know if the animals are real or not; we get to choose. Pi starts the book by saying ""this book will make you believe in God"", and when revealing that people can choose which story they see as the truth, he ties back to that opening with ""and so it is with God"". The book even ends by revealing that the reporters(?) chose to believe in the story with the tiger. I feel like it's pretty clear that the author kind of wants you to pick the ""less believable"" story, even.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm not religious, and the book definitely didn't make me believe in God, but the message of the story is still powerful to me in the sense that, so long as it's not hurting anyone, we don't need to get swept up in who's ""right"" about religion or stories or really anything (I'm looking at you, r/thatHappened). So when people miss this whole message and chalk the book up to, ""the animals were metaphorical all along!"", I feel like they're missing the best part of the story.

&amp;#x200B;

And if you're wondering what specifically set me off to write this (beyond the horrible injustice that was the movie), it was this blog talking about plot twists:

In general, how much damage can you live with before you return a book?

I don't want to be too much of a stickler and keep things realistic because at least hardcover books seem to get some kind of shipping damage 80-90% of the time, no matter where I order my books from or who delivers them. Worst case, a return and reorder might make things worse.

That being said, hardcover books are expensive and pretty visible showpieces, so of course I would like them to be pristine.

I would love buy local and have a look at the books in advance but I live in a non-English speaking country, so my English books have to be ordered and shipped anyway.

Here are two examples from the current delivery I'm on the fence about regarding my initial question:

https://i.imgur.com/hnAhQ8t.jpg

The abrasion is worse than on the photos but at least this one was kinda cheap at about 9 dollars and the dust jacket is fine (though I like to display books without the jacket).

https://i.imgur.com/vWflY4w.jpg

This one is worse because it's a large book and the damage is very visible, especially without the jacket. Plus, it's a 25 dollars book. Then again it is already a second delivery that is better than the first. The first one had a tear in the spine at exactly the same spot.

I've read plenty of books with songs as parts of characters and the story. But rarely manage to catch the tune that the author would have intended. It's often worse when I read with a tune as a word in another verse breaks the flow of my melody. Even on re-reads I have this issue.

Most obvious examples being Lord of the Rings, where music is a key theme all the way through the lore. Or even Game of Thrones where foreshadowing and prophesy are tucked away in a bards verse. Though this transcends just fantasy novels.

I'm not musically inclined but always feel like I'm missing out on some magic in the text when I can't pickup a song.

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong. I love the book. But I just want someone to confirm if they saw this too, or to just explain something I probably didn’t get haha.&lt;/p&gt;

He died a few years ago but I only found time now  to unpack the books and have a little read.

The oldest book is from 1937. Its called ""Der Admiral"" and was written by Eberhard Wolfgang Möller. It has ""only"" 54 Pages.
But before I could even start reading I found a little note in it that says: In true Companionship your Friend Heinz. It is signed by his Friend (I imagine). And has the Year 1939 (Christmas) left to it. So this was in World War II. It is quite Hard to read since it is written in Deutscheschrift.


Then there are 3 Books written by Janusz Meissner. 

-Das Grüne Tor   (The Green Door)

-Die Schwarze Flagge (The Black Flag)

-Die Roten Kreuze ( Red Crosses)

They were written in 1963 and are absolutly Beautiful. I can write a Summary if you want.

The rest of the ""Books"" are shortstories and are written by a Variety of Authors from GDR and USSR. The Time they were written in vary from 1953 to 1989.

Scriving is very difficult, requires a lot of education, and is really only useful when huge teams of scrivers coordinate on a handful of projects - so, much like technology in our world, magic has come to be dominated by four giant merchant houses, which have used it to found brutal, ruthless trade empires.

Since then, we have removed suggestion threads and directed their posters to this thread instead.  This tradition continues, so let's jump right in!

 **The Rules**

 * Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.

 **How to get the best recommendations**

 The most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.

Every single character was unique and well-written but most memorable for me would be Cathy and Charles; I loved how hateful and sociopathic she was, truly perfect antagonist; Yet she had her humane moments too. And Charles, man... Tragic one if you ask me. So so good.

And the part about Tom and Dessie and how their story ended; How emotional and powerful. yet sad at the same time.

I loved every page of it, man. Characterization and story is surprisingly perfect. I wanted to find its flaw but, subjectively, truly couldn&amp;#39;t. It turned out to be &amp;#39;my&amp;#39; kind of book. It&amp;#39;s a chilling, captivating read. Every single character is realistic and human with their strengths and weaknesses; I kept continuously thinking about the characters and analyzing their traits while in car, train, walking or at the lesson. I was persistently drawing parallels between the book and my own life, related to several characters on different levels.  I&amp;#39;m kinda proud to say 18 here and nobody forced me to read it (school, uni); Also, It&amp;#39;s a first Steinbeck for me, and damn... It doesn&amp;#39;t always happen that I wish I didn&amp;#39;t finish a book. This time it definitely did.&lt;/p&gt;

At first, I was very excited. I thought I’d found amazing deals on these books I’ve wanted to own for quite a while now, but had never gone through with buying because my family is in a pretty tough spot with money right now. 

But then (after buying the ebooks) I noticed something on the Amazon page for “Murder on the Orient Express”: It had a little warning sign of some sort that said people had reported *typos* in the ebook, and that the publisher had been contacted about fixing the typos.

I’ve never seen that warning sign before or since on anything else - not even on the Kindle ebooks that I’ve downloaded for free - and now I can’t find the page again. The publisher’s name is typed on the cover page of the $0.99 ebooks as “Real Epublisher”, and I guess that’s all I have to go on now.

I haven’t really had the chance to read through them yet; but, from just a couple cursory glances, I haven’t seen any serious typos. But I can’t stop thinking about it. I don’t want to think that parts of the book/books are wrong. I want to be able to trust what I’m reading.

And what I really want to know is this: What happens when an ebook publisher edits their books? Will my Kindle app do an automatic update? Or do I need to do something myself? Or have I just “missed out” on it, because I bought and downloaded it before the corrections were made?

While these omissions have been discussed before, I think enough has changed since 1997 to warrant the release of an unmodified version. No disrespect to the original translation (which works quite well), but there are a few reasons why the book deserves a revisit, and why doing so would be a viable option:

1) Haruki Murakami is a more internationally renowned name, with much more marketability.

2) *Wind-Up Bird* remains one of Murakami’s most acclaimed works.

3) The deleted content adds context to the characters (&gt;!the very act of burning Kumiko’s clothing adds a significant layer to Mr. Wind-Up Bird!&lt;).

4) *1Q84* dwarfs even a completed version of *Wind-Up Bird*, suggesting that length is no longer a primary concern.

5) According to Rubin himself, a completed translation already exists:

“Afraid that they would hire some freelancer who could wreak havoc on the novel, and filled with a megalomaniac certainty that I knew every word in the book--maybe better than the author himself--after having translated all three hefty volumes, I decided to forestall the horror by submitting my manuscript in two versions: complete, and cut. Knopf took my cut version pretty much as is...”

6) Reception to Murakami’s latest books seems more critical. Now might be a good time to remind sceptics of what made him worth paying attention to.

7) Considering Killing Commendatore released not too long ago, this could supplement the gap until his next novel. 

I’m sure there are many more reasons an uncut version of *Wind-Up Bird* is well deserved. However, I am aware that there would be complications, most notably that any such re-release would inevitably have limited sales. While I’m not a publisher, I see two possible ways of countering this:

1) Release a limited print, hardcover edition. Perhaps get an introduction from Murakami himself and/or the translators. Make a fancy cover, call it an ‘Anniversary’ or ‘Collector’s’ Edition and charge a premium.

2) Release it digitally.

It seems to me that Murakami is enough of a marketable name, and this book is special to enough people, that one of these options should be capable of giving us what we want while still turning a profit. 

However, herein lies the major roadblock: convincing Knopf that we want it.

It seems a pretty safe assumption that an uncut re-release would never cross Knopf’s mind without demand. Alas, it does not seem like Knopf provides any viable method of showing such demand. I visited their ‘contact us’ page, and the only thing that comes close is a generic webmaster address that likely leads to a virtual dumpster. I sent a request regardless, but surely there must be a superior method of contact.

Ultimately I am only one person, and big publishers do not budge for individual consumers. If you share my desire for an unaltered version of *Wind-Up Bird*, please consider a method by which we might contact Knopf and show them that support for this does exist; show them that this is not only something we want, but something that we are willing to spend money on. If English is not your native language, consider that most translations seem to derive from the English one.

I believe that seeing an uncut version of this book, while improbable, is not impossible. I don’t know what it will take to get Knopf’s attention – hell, as I’ve said, I don’t even know *how* – but I want to do *something* to make this desire a reality. I hope that in making this post, I can inspire others to do the same.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not a secret that the present English translation of Haruki Murakami’s &lt;em&gt;The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; is, among other modifications, missing chapters and pages. While these omissions have been discussed before, I think enough has changed since 1997 to warrant the release of an unmodified version. No disrespect to the original translation (which works quite well), but there are a few reasons why the book deserves a revisit, and why doing so would be a viable option:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Haruki Murakami is a more internationally renowned name, with much more marketability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;em&gt;Wind-Up Bird&lt;/em&gt; remains one of Murakami’s most acclaimed works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) The deleted content adds context to the characters (&lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;the very act of burning Kumiko’s clothing adds a significant layer to Mr. Wind-Up Bird&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) &lt;em&gt;1Q84&lt;/em&gt; dwarfs even a completed version of &lt;em&gt;Wind-Up Bird&lt;/em&gt;, suggesting that length is no longer a primary concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) According to Rubin himself, a completed translation already exists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Afraid that they would hire some freelancer who could wreak havoc on the novel, and filled with a megalomaniac certainty that I knew every word in the book--maybe better than the author himself--after having translated all three hefty volumes, I decided to forestall the horror by submitting my manuscript in two versions: complete, and cut. Knopf took my cut version pretty much as is...”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) Reception to Murakami’s latest books seems more critical. Now might be a good time to remind sceptics of what made him worth paying attention to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) Considering Killing Commendatore released not too long ago, this could supplement the gap until his next novel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure there are many more reasons an uncut version of &lt;em&gt;Wind-Up Bird&lt;/em&gt; is well deserved. However, I am aware that there would be complications, most notably that any such re-release would inevitably have limited sales. While I’m not a publisher, I see two possible ways of countering this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Release a limited print, hardcover edition. Perhaps get an introduction from Murakami himself and/or the translators. Make a fancy cover, call it an ‘Anniversary’ or ‘Collector’s’ Edition and charge a premium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Release it digitally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that Murakami is enough of a marketable name, and this book is special to enough people, that one of these options should be capable of giving us what we want while still turning a profit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, herein lies the major roadblock: convincing Knopf that we want it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems a pretty safe assumption that an uncut re-release would never cross Knopf’s mind without demand. Alas, it does not seem like Knopf provides any viable method of showing such demand. I visited their ‘contact us’ page, and the only thing that comes close is a generic webmaster address that likely leads to a virtual dumpster. I sent a request regardless, but surely there must be a superior method of contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately I am only one person, and big publishers do not budge for individual consumers. If you share my desire for an unaltered version of &lt;em&gt;Wind-Up Bird&lt;/em&gt;, please consider a method by which we might contact Knopf and show them that support for this does exist; show them that this is not only something we want, but something that we are willing to spend money on. If English is not your native language, consider that most translations seem to derive from the English one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that seeing an uncut version of this book, while improbable, is not impossible. I don’t know what it will take to get Knopf’s attention – hell, as I’ve said, I don’t even know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; – but I want to do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; to make this desire a reality.

Like 3 years ago, although I can't find a copy of it on bookstores and only just stumbled upon this novel by accident during a bookfair. During those times, I am trying to foresee on what I should read and what happens to the story, characters, etc. while trying to avoid spoilers. Now that I've finished it, boy did it exceed my expectations.

The characters, places, the prose, everything was beautiful as it is. All of the characters at the novel seemed interesting and memorable as they are. The most memorable being Judge Holden. The novel itself, though seeming as violent as it is, is just where the beauty and the message in it lies. The violence and beauty intersect together until you see them as one. This novel also put me through a rollercoaster of emotions. For example, at the first parts of the novel does it paint to the reader a picture of how violent and savage the Indians were, it tells you certain foreshadowings, and forms of allegory. I felt that the indians were as vicious as they are or crude as they seem at the first parts of the novel, then as the novel progresses towards the victories of the Glanton gang, and ideals and views of the Judge, did I empathize with the so called ""savages"" themselves and see them as the true victims here.
Aside from those things mentioned above, the novel leaves an impactful message as to how society is. The allegories and/or meanings hinted and mentioned at the novel also paints an idea about how things can be viewed and treated. I find myself agreeing with most of what the Judge says even though he can be called as this madman, while at the same time agreeing with the rebuttals or the exchanges of the characters with him. I'd say that this novel is a solid 10/10 for me. It's definitely Cormac McCarthy's magnum opus.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off, I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to buy this novel since way back after a thread I read.

 And yes, I actually like cliffhangers, even if most people don't seem to like them. They give YOU the choice to end the story, in your own imagination. Do you want the main character to make  this or that choice ? You can do that, because the author doesn't tell you the ending, therefore it can be whatever you want it to be.

My least favourite is definitely an epilogue, I just can't really enjoy them. They do the exact opposite of a cliffhanger, and give you no choice but to accept exactly what ending the author wants. Like, most of the time, you get a whole family and kids to your main character, even if you didn't want them to even end up with a specific love interest.

I’m not a big reader and I picked up this book and *Rainbow Six* a couple years back.  I immediately read *Rainbow Six* and loved it, but got busy and hadn’t gotten around to reading *Red October* because I got busy.  I just binge-read it (if that’s a thing) in under a week and lemme tell ya: it was awesome!

I finished the last 150 pages today and I loved the ending.  That was my biggest gripe about *Rainbow Six* — I felt like the ending was a bit unrealistic.  *Red October*’s ending, on the other hand, while a bit over-the-top, felt believable.  I loved Ramirez as a character, as well as Jones and Mancuso.  The only major complaint is that with so many characters, it got really hard to keep track of the minor ones (i.e. Greer, Pelt, Padorin, etc.).  I really just stopped paying attention to their roles by the end.  Also, I wish there had been some more explanation as to what some of the words meant (like “conn”, I have no clue what that means).  I guess I could google it but I’m too lazy at this point.

I also watched the movie right after an that was a disappointment.   I guess with a book as long as *Red October* you can’t really cram it into a 2 hour film.   The movie left out a lot of key plot points and would probably be very confusing to see if you hadn’t read the book already.  I also didn’t like it because it took my favorite character, Ramius, and made him into an arrogant and mean old man.  In the book he is much more friendly, especially to his officers and enlisted sailors, and isn’t as arrogant as he is smart and clever.  Other than that though, a decent film, and an even better book.

The other issue I had — or not so much an issue as a comment — was that I really don’t get what the fuss is with Jack Ryan.  I know a lot of people love him and I saw in other threads people recommending to read all of the books about him, but I dunno.  His character wasn’t very relatable, and he was kinda a baby throughout the whole thing, not really doing much except for his analysis in the beginning and the shootout in the end.  I would much rather read another book about Ramius than another about Jack Ryan, but that’s just me.

I give it a 8.5/10.  I personally liked *Rainbow Six* better because it has more action, but it’s 100% personal preference.  *Red October* is definitely more realistic and I can appreciate that.

Let me preface this by saying that I am a daily reader and a lover of reading. I read both for pleasure and for my studies  in university which gives me LOTS of material to read. I recently noticed that I often spend much more time than my peers finishing reading assignments - by a lot. I read more than most people I know but I do not cover much ground. I roughly estimated my reading speed today and came out at a measly 160 wpm. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and began taking medication which helps the intensity of my focus, but my reading speed has not changed significantly. What makes me particularly slow I think is that I regularly find that in the middle of my reading I have no idea what the last paragraph about, and I often have to re-read sentences or paragraphs.

This is becoming a massive hindrance to finishing all of the reading I have to do for school, I was wondering If any readers out there have had similar experiences and if so how can I work towards increasing my speed. Thank you!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello &lt;a href=""/r/books""&gt;r/books&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me preface this by saying that I am a daily reader and a lover of reading. I read both for pleasure and for my studies  in university which gives me LOTS of material to read. I recently noticed that I often spend much more time than my peers finishing reading assignments - by a lot. I read more than most people I know but I do not cover much ground. I roughly estimated my reading speed today and came out at a measly 160 wpm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and began taking medication which helps the intensity of my focus, but my reading speed has not changed significantly. What makes me particularly slow I think is that I regularly find that in the middle of my reading I have no idea what the last paragraph about, and I often have to re-read sentences or paragraphs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is becoming a massive hindrance to finishing all of the reading I have to do for school, I was wondering If any readers out there have had similar experiences and if so how can I work towards increasing my speed. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

I suspect Tayari Jones' *An American Marriage* will stand the test of time.  It is fiction based on a black man in the South who is falsely accused of rape and sent to prison, but it that isn't really the point of the novel. Instead it is ultimately about marriage and how it survives (or doesn't) a trying situation and how subtle or explicit racism can be.

It let me know there were creative ways to be and live in nature.

I loved the simplicity of it even if it was all quite terrifying for child me to imagine living without my Mom and Dad alone in the woods taking care of my siblings.

Island of the Blue Dolphins did the same, and it planted in me this huge desire to live in isolation, to make and grow and be a strong emotional part of the world in which I lived. To be critical of strangers with false smiles over evil eyes. To embrace the worst periods of your life in a way and make the best of them. To find solace in times of grief, companionship in the strangest of places as well as through barriers of communication. A strong respect for the dead. For death, for the brevity of life.

Today I reached the halfway mark!

Part of the reason I chose this challenge for myself is simply because I love to read. But more than that, it’s because I can think of no better way to improve as a writer. I’ve learned so much about the craft in the past year—let alone the past five months—and I’ve really enjoyed getting to know all of these authors. (Well maybe not all of them—looking at you, Salinger.)

These are my six favorite reads so far, (because I couldn’t decide on number five). If you see any of your favorites, let me know in the comments!

1. “All The Light We Cannot See” by Anthony Doerr.
2. “The Things They Carried” by Tim O’Brien.
3. “Frankenstein” by Mary Shelley
4. “Lolita” by Vladimir Nabokov
5. “In Harm’s Way” by Doug Stanton
6. “Treasure Island” by Robert Louis Stevenson

Honorable mentions to “A Man Called Ove” by Fredrick Bachman, “All Quiet on the Western Front” by Erich Maria Remarque, “Sh\*t My Dad Says” by Justin Halpern, “City of Thieves” by that assclown David Benioff, and “The Pianist” by Wladyslaw Szpilman.

I’ve been able to read so much more this year by replacing a lot of my phone time with reading (ironic, I know) and the same with aimless TV watching (as opposed to turning on the TV to watch something specific). I also try to get an audiobook version of the book I’m reading from the library so I can “read” on my way to and from work.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: A lot of people have asked how I retain information from the books I read. Great question! This is certainly something I've worried about. The best thing for me has been writing my own summary and ""review"" in an Evernote folder just after finishing the book, or a few days after. I don't do it with every book I read, but definitely with the ones I really like. When I write the review, I do it in the author's own prose. I find that this method is also a great writing exercise. For an example, here's my ""review in borrowed prose"" of Frankenstein:

&gt;Oh! only that I could portray adequately, dear friends, the utmost love and affection that I hold thither my heart for a tale such as this. Poor Frankenstein’s daemon, the miserable wretch! 

&amp;#x200B;

And a considerably longer “review in borrowed prose” for a book I **didn't** like, The Catcher in the Rye:

&gt;Overall I think this story is a whole big bunch of baloney. This Salinger guy, he just really can’t seem to get to the point. The whole thing just crawls all over the place and doesn’t really go *any*where. Boy, I hate it when a story doesn’t go anywhere. Really, it makes me mad as hell.   
&gt;  
&gt;I get that some people think it's grand. I get it. I really do. This guy I knew back in school, Ritchie Whitcore, he thought it was real grand. They made us all read it for a book report, the whole goddam class. I don’t remember a good bit, to tell you the truth. I was busy looking at old Jane in the row in front of me. She wore these dresses that were tight around the middle and boy, I just couldn’t get enough of her. She turned me into a madman, honest. Anyway, we finished this damn book and I thought I was gonna die I was so bored from it. But old Ritchie said that he thought it was interesting, how “Holden’s story represents a teenager’s struggle between the flightiness of childhood and the unpleasant responsibility of becoming an adult.” That killed me. Some people can just go on and on and on about anything. The teacher, Mrs. Dunmore, she really loved it. She just ate it up. What a bunch of phonies.  
&gt;  
&gt;I mean I guess I under*stand* what he meant. The story overall is kind of neat in the way old Salinger shows how a teenager might think. But *boy*, does it crawl all over the place. All those parts about nothing made me wanna scoop my old eyeballs out. Really, they did. I'd probably smoke a hundred cigarettes for every goddam page of this book if I had to read it by myself. Boy, it was really lousy a lot of the time.  
&gt;  
&gt;The one thing old Salinger got right though, if you want to know, is the way he tells the whole thing. I sure hate when a story doesn’t go anywhere, but sometimes—even if a writer’s a big phony overall—I can like how they talk. Sallinger, he could talk like a real genius, if you want to know the truth. He really could. I knew this guy in sixth grade who was about the biggest phony I ever met. I wouldn't believe a word out of him. But boy, could he talk. He could talk so good you had to love the guy even though you knew he was such a phony. That’s what this Salinger guy does. Half the time I just want to smack him in his old head when I think about how this story doesn’t go any goddam where. But boy, the way he *talks* I can’t help but like him. I’m not sayin I love the guy or whatever, but I do like the way he talks in the book. That’s about the only thing I like. That and how it does a good job at showing how a teenager might think. But boy, this whole book isn't about a goddam thing. It really isn’t.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 1st I decided to try to read 100 books this year.

(Well maybe not all of them—looking at you, Salinger.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are my six favorite reads so far, (because I couldn’t decide on number five). If you see any of your favorites, let me know in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“All The Light We Cannot See” by Anthony Doerr.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The Things They Carried” by Tim O’Brien.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Frankenstein” by Mary Shelley&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Lolita” by Vladimir Nabokov&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“In Harm’s Way” by Doug Stanton&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Treasure Island” by Robert Louis Stevenson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honorable mentions to “A Man Called Ove” by Fredrick Bachman, “All Quiet on the Western Front” by Erich Maria Remarque, “Sh*t My Dad Says” by Justin Halpern, “City of Thieves” by that assclown David Benioff, and “The Pianist” by Wladyslaw Szpilman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been able to read so much more this year by replacing a lot of my phone time with reading (ironic, I know) and the same with aimless TV watching (as opposed to turning on the TV to watch something specific). I also try to get an audiobook version of the book I’m reading from the library so I can “read” on my way to and from work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: A lot of people have asked how I retain information from the books I read. Great question! This is certainly something I&amp;#39;ve worried about. The best thing for me has been writing my own summary and &amp;quot;review&amp;quot; in an Evernote folder just after finishing the book, or a few days after. I don&amp;#39;t do it with every book I read, but definitely with the ones I really like. When I write the review, I do it in the author&amp;#39;s own prose. I find that this method is also a great writing exercise. For an example, here&amp;#39;s my &amp;quot;review in borrowed prose&amp;quot; of Frankenstein:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh! only that I could portray adequately, dear friends, the utmost love and affection that I hold thither my heart for a tale such as this. Poor Frankenstein’s daemon, the miserable wretch! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a considerably longer “review in borrowed prose” for a book I &lt;strong&gt;didn&amp;#39;t&lt;/strong&gt; like, The Catcher in the Rye:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I think this story is a whole big bunch of baloney. This Salinger guy, he just really can’t seem to get to the point. The whole thing just crawls all over the place and doesn’t really go &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt;where. Boy, I hate it when a story doesn’t go anywhere. Really, it makes me mad as hell.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get that some people think it&amp;#39;s grand. I get it. I really do. This guy I knew back in school, Ritchie Whitcore, he thought it was real grand. They made us all read it for a book report, the whole goddam class. I don’t remember a good bit, to tell you the truth. I was busy looking at old Jane in the row in front of me. She wore these dresses that were tight around the middle and boy, I just couldn’t get enough of her. She turned me into a madman, honest. Anyway, we finished this damn book and I thought I was gonna die I was so bored from it. But old Ritchie said that he thought it was interesting, how “Holden’s story represents a teenager’s struggle between the flightiness of childhood and the unpleasant responsibility of becoming an adult.” That killed me. Some people can just go on and on and on about anything. The teacher, Mrs. Dunmore, she really loved it. She just ate it up. What a bunch of phonies.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean I guess I under&lt;em&gt;stand&lt;/em&gt; what he meant. The story overall is kind of neat in the way old Salinger shows how a teenager might think. But &lt;em&gt;boy&lt;/em&gt;, does it crawl all over the place. All those parts about nothing made me wanna scoop my old eyeballs out. Really, they did. I&amp;#39;d probably smoke a hundred cigarettes for every goddam page of this book if I had to read it by myself. Boy, it was really lousy a lot of the time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing old Salinger got right though, if you want to know, is the way he tells the whole thing. I sure hate when a story doesn’t go anywhere, but sometimes—even if a writer’s a big phony overall—I can like how they talk. Sallinger, he could talk like a real genius, if you want to know the truth. He really could. I knew this guy in sixth grade who was about the biggest phony I ever met. I wouldn&amp;#39;t believe a word out of him. But boy, could he talk. He could talk so good you had to love the guy even though you knew he was such a phony. That’s what this Salinger guy does. Half the time I just want to smack him in his old head when I think about how this story doesn’t go any goddam where. But boy, the way he &lt;em&gt;talks&lt;/em&gt; I can’t help but like him. I’m not sayin I love the guy or whatever, but I do like the way he talks in the book. That’s about the only thing I like. That and how it does a good job at showing how a teenager might think. But boy, this whole book isn&amp;#39;t about a goddam thing. It really isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

Do you have a favorite publisher? Not many people really talk about publishers like this. So in pursuit of this curiosity of certain publishers, I mapped out a timeline of their evolution showing when publishing houses began, merged and where they are now. It gave me a good visual of how these company names came to be when I look at their title page with their name on the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

[Evolution of The Publishers](https://imgur.com/7smRFkO) I hope this is clear enough as it was confusing. I could not put in every last detail. I focused on the large publishers which there seems to be 5 or 6, depending on who is counting. I thought running vertical would be easier to see, but I laid it out [horizontally](https://imgur.com/a/i6Q4tUg) if you think this is easier to look out.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have a favorite publisher? Not many people really talk about publishers like this. So in pursuit of this curiosity of certain publishers, I mapped out a timeline of their evolution showing when publishing houses began, merged and where they are now. It gave me a good visual of how these company names came to be when I look at their title page with their name on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/7smRFkO""&gt;Evolution of The Publishers&lt;/a&gt; I hope this is clear enough as it was confusing. I could not put in every last detail. I focused on the large publishers which there seems to be 5 or 6, depending on who is counting. I thought running vertical would be easier to see, but I laid it out &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/i6Q4tUg""&gt;horizontally&lt;/a&gt; if you think this is easier to look out.  Hopefully it all makes sense and there are not too many errors.&lt;/p&gt;

This work doesn't really get the traction of his other works, but I definitely think it's well worth your time to read if you're a fan of his other works. Since this was his first novel, you can feel him honing his style, but so many of the classic Vonnegut-isms were there. 

The dystopian genre is crowded and the 'technology as a threat' genre is definitely well-worn, but one aspect of this story that I greatly appreciated was that Vonnegut never let us forget that human beings were in charge of the machines. It was people who designed and built the machines that dictated and rationalized so much of public life. Nor was it particularly evil in its origin. The machines were a natural extension of our own desire to create devices to make our lives better and easier and it became easier to rationalize automated processes taking over for human labor as the error rate is so much lower and the product objectively better and cheaper. Nevertheless, the end result was a world in which people had most if not all of their basic needs met, but were also alienated at this existence as they didn't have the agency to pursue lives of our own choosing. 

It was pretty apparent that he was still finding his voice as a writer as the book had a few problems. There are some plotholes, the female characters are extremely poorly written,  the Shah travels America plotline probably doesn't read that well in 2019. I don't think it was a particularly funny book, at least not compared to some of his later works. But you can tell that the wit and wisdom is there. I feel like Vonnegut sometimes writes like he's just a nice guy who knows a lot of random things and through his side characters he just gives us these random pieces knowledge that he's picked up somewhere in his life knowing that he has a captive audience. I don't even know if they're true or not, they very well might not be, which would be even funnier.

This is a quality that I would like to see more attention towards as I firmly believe that it is one of the distinguishing factors between a good author, and a great one.

**What do I mean?**

What I mean by clearly and concisely communicating space, position, and movement, is the ability of an author to deliver all of the relevant information to the reader about the space in which a scene is set, the position of everything in that space, and the movement of everything through that space. 

**In Practice**

This starts off simple, basic, X person walked through Y door and sat in Z chair. But this is where the *relevant* part comes into play, relevant information is *any* piece of information about something's space, position, or movement which is necessary for the reader to know in order to understand what happens in the space.
Let's start with just looking at position, (and a minimal amount of space because information about the space is necessary for even a basic understanding of the scene) in a very basic manner and use the example of a baseball bat. If you hit someone with a baseball bat, that bat can't come from thin air, either someone brought it into the space, or it was there already and they grabbed it, either way the reader needs to know that the baseball bat was present before it was used. So what we would need to know is 

* The dimensions of the space

* The position of the characters within the space

* The position of the bat in the space

Essentially this is Chekhov's Gun in reverse, if a gun is fired in a story, it must be shown at some point beforehand. Now this is all still very basic stuff, but this is with just position and space, and in a very basic form. Let's go back to the baseball bat, this time fleshing it out. Let's assume that the baseball bat is present in the space already. Looking at position, the relevant information would be:

* The dimensions of the space

* The position of the characters, in relation to the space, each other, and the bat

* The position of the bat in relation to the space and the characters

* The dimensions of anything in between the characters and the bat

* The position of anything in between the characters and the bat in relation to the space, the characters, the bat, and anything else in between the characters and the bat

* The dimensions of anything in between the characters and each other

* The position of anything in between the characters and each other in relation to the space, the characters, and anything else in between the characters and each other

As you can see it gets complex very quickly, however, all of this can be taken care of with a description that includes all of the information required to figure this out for yourself, In reality, something like this would work: 
Person A and Person B are sitting in a small, square room. There is window on the wall opposite the entrance, there is a bank of chairs along the left wall, there are two side tables, one on either side of the bank of chairs, each with a lamp on top, and a basket containing some magazines below, on the right wall there is a closed door which leads into an office, against the closer side table rests a baseball bat. Person A and Person B are sitting on opposite ends of the bank of chairs. 

It isn't particularly hard to cover your bases, you just need to plan accordingly, however this is still missing a key part of the picture.

**Movement**

Up to this point we've only been looking at position and space. But position and space aren't generally where I see most authors fail, chances are that if you're a half decent author, you have those figured out. Where most people falter, is movement. Without movement you have a picture of a single moment, frozen in time, adding it in necessitates that you not only consider a third layer of relevant information, but also that you communicate the way that information changes. It is important to communicate not only the movement, but how the positions of everything within the space change in response, and if necessary, how the space itself changes in response. If changing the space is a bit hard to grasp, think of the ""The Floor is Down"" moment in Ender's Game.

Many authors just don't manage to keep track of both the movement and the response, but even for those that do, there is another obstacle to conquer.

**The Tunnel**

Most good authors make it to this point, where *they* fail is a rather insidious pitfall which I am going to refer to as tunnel vision. Where Tunnel Vision always seems to rear it's ugly head is in battle scenes, Tunnel Vision is where the focus narrows to a small part of the scene, to the detriment of the whole. If we're talking battle scenes, what you tend to see is: X swings their sword, Y blocks with their shield, X scratches Y's arm, Y decapitates X. 

The problem here is that the focus of the scene narrows to the upper bodies of two people, to the exclusion of literally everything else. Not only is it boring, but it lacks any information about the two characters' movement through the space, their positions at any point in time, or the movement of anything besides whichever arm is the current focal point.  This leads not only to scenes which are confusing to follow because the reader has suddenly been disconnected from the space, and any sense of position within it, but also to a jarring break of their immersion when they have to try and figure out how someone fell off the balcony, when the last thing they remember, everyone was at the bottom of the stairs. 

**The Force Carrier**

Effective communication of position, space, and movement is different, not in that it lacks the same level of focus, but in what that focus is directed at, and in that it is less narrowed, if not by much. Instead of the focus being on the action, the movement, the focus is on the what I call the Force Carrier. The Force Carrier is whatever bridges one action to it's corresponding reaction, and then whatever bridges the reaction to the reaction, and so on, In a fight scene, for example, the action could be a punch, the carrier could be a block, and the reaction could be the person who blocked, stumbling back from the force of the block. In a more extended example you could have a fight where each blow is redirected to the advantage of the defender, whose redirection leads into an attack, which is the redirected back at them. The carrier is a vehicle for keeping the focus of the scene on whatever is the most important part of said scene, with each focus transitioning to a new one as the scene shifts. This allows the fight to be one uninterrupted sequence, as opposed to a disconnected stop and start, and with every important action leading to the next, it becomes much more difficult to miss important details and end up confused when they come into play.

The best example that comes to mind is from Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn, It is Kelsier's fight against a group of foes, in a noble family's keep, involving a heavy metal paperweight, It is a fantastic example of how to create a flow of cause and effect in a fight, and is a fantastic example of effective communication of position, space, and movement working in tandem to immerse the reader and communicate effectively.

TL;DR:
* Give the reader the information necessary to visualize the space, and the positions and movement of anything within.
* Remember, Your characters have legs, use them!
* Each important action should lead to the next.

Hopefully I explained this in a clear enough manner, if anyone has any suggestions I would love to hear them

I really enjoyed how bizarre this true crime story was, but mostly how Wallace didn't just describe a heist, he weaved history, memoir, science, and true crime together to create a beautifully written non-fiction. After seeing [u/conservio](https://www.reddit.com/u/conservio/) [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/bc2sb8/my_library_offers_a_customized_reading_list_here/) here about asking their local librarian for personal recommendations I did the same and was recommended The Orchid Thief by Susan Orlean. I emailed the librarian who sent me the recs saying thank you and he said he wanted to recommend one more book, The Library Book by Susan Orlean. I decided to read that asap since his recommendation was glowing.

Anyways, I just finished it over the weekend and wow! It's about so much more than the fire that happened at LA Central Library in 1986 (which I didn't know about before reading the book), and I think that's what I love so much about it. Orlean does talk about the fire/aftermath/crime, but also writes a broader story about the history of libraries in the US and a little bit around the world, the colorful history of the LA Central library (honestly never thought any library history would be all that interesting but I was wrong!), the day-to-day life of librarians and other library related jobs, Orlean's personal connection to the library, and the cultural significance of libraries. It also happens to be a beautiful book.

I didn't realize people call their local libraries for answers to simple questions (or philosophical questions like what is more evil a grasshopper or cicada, I can't remember the exact quote from the book but you get the idea), or how to restore water-logged books, or that the LA Central library is almost 150 years old. My best friend is a librarian and I have a much deeper appreciation for what she does and what libraries do for the community in general, something I don't think I would have developed without reading this book! Has anyone else read it??

After seeing &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/u/conservio/""&gt;u/conservio&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/bc2sb8/my_library_offers_a_customized_reading_list_here/""&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; here about asking their local librarian for personal recommendations I did the same and was recommended The Orchid Thief by Susan Orlean. I emailed the librarian who sent me the recs saying thank you and he said he wanted to recommend one more book, The Library Book by Susan Orlean. I decided to read that asap since his recommendation was glowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I just finished it over the weekend and wow! It&amp;#39;s about so much more than the fire that happened at LA Central Library in 1986 (which I didn&amp;#39;t know about before reading the book), and I think that&amp;#39;s what I love so much about it. Orlean does talk about the fire/aftermath/crime, but also writes a broader story about the history of libraries in the US and a little bit around the world, the colorful history of the LA Central library (honestly never thought any library history would be all that interesting but I was wrong!), the day-to-day life of librarians and other library related jobs, Orlean&amp;#39;s personal connection to the library, and the cultural significance of libraries. It also happens to be a beautiful book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t realize people call their local libraries for answers to simple questions (or philosophical questions like what is more evil a grasshopper or cicada, I can&amp;#39;t remember the exact quote from the book but you get the idea), or how to restore water-logged books, or that the LA Central library is almost 150 years old. My best friend is a librarian and I have a much deeper appreciation for what she does and what libraries do for the community in general, something I don&amp;#39;t think I would have developed without reading this book! Has anyone else read it??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

I was thinking maybe she would redeemed herself by the end of the story, but nope. Throughout the rest of the book I felt awful for hating the main character. Am I just not understanding female lead now? Is this how strong woman really act? Frankly I almost felt like I have become a misogynist, somehow.

The story itself has so much potential in my opinion. I still like the Artemis bubbles concept, the political drama and even some of the side characters.

The characters felt very real, and the story of being lost in your own world and problems while the world was falling apart around you, slowly encroaching on the life you knew is a classic tale of youth. The desperate attempt to hold onto the life you knew before being thrust into adulthood is universal and poweful. The friendship, and possible romance, between Finny and Gene is emotional and beautiful, and when the book ends the journeys of both characters directly reflects the themes the novel has been building upon.

Usually after I finish reading a book, any piece of media, really, I look online to see what others thought. To my surprise, the book was highly divisive. Many people despise this book, and it surprised me. 

SPOILERS FOLLOW

The biggest criticisms seem to be about how unrelatable the characters and their problems are. They are rich, priviledged white boys who are effectively avoiding WW2 by going to a private school. While yes, the setting is something most of us have never and will never see, that does not invalidate the central message, being robbed of one's youth and being thrust into adulthood, whether they are ready or not. The idea that books have to be relatable to have value is  an school of thought that I dislike. While the story may not be 'relatable' on a surface level, the theme is universal. At one point or another, we have to grow up. It happens at different times for all of us, as it does for all of us. The character that represents eternal youth, Finny, was damaged at the end of summer, and by the end of winter he is dead, effectively ending Gene's childhood and bringing him into adulthood.

When I started reading the novel, I knew absolutely nothing about it. So when it came to Finny and Gene's relationship, I was surprised by how homoerotic it was. Personally, I read it with a queer theory lense, and to me that really enhanced my reading experience. Gene constantly wrestles with his feelings for Finny. He does not understand if he is a friend or a rival, but Gene feels a strong pull toward him, and ultimately succumbs to Finny's endless charms. This wrestling of emotions during a time of great change.is something I imagine young LGBTQ+ people deal with constantly. Especially at a time where gay relationships were uncommon, Gene's entanglement with Finny being something he cannot put into words becomes much more powerful. He feels somwthing for Finny that he cannot understand, and this causes him to act irrationally. Whether or not you see the relationship as romantic or platonic, it is a striking one, and it is undeniable how Gene's love and loss of Finny is what causes him to fall into his cold, depressing adulthood. 

So yeah, just a few unfocused thought on *A Seperate Peace.* I am curious to see what r/books has to say about it. As is probably clear, I loved it, and a few tears my have been shed at the sudden death of Finny... but enough about that. What do you guys think? I'd love to see what you guys think, and hopefully have a discussion with you all about our thoughts, because love it or hate it I think it's a book worth talking about.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently decided that I was going to read the high school &amp;#39;staples&amp;#39; that I never read in school, such as &lt;em&gt;1984&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein.&lt;/em&gt; As the title states, a couple of weeks ago I finished John Knowles&amp;#39; classic piece of YA fiction, &lt;em&gt;A Seperate Peace.&lt;/em&gt; Personally, I loved it.

I just finished reading it and God damn I was filled with a plethora of emotions. The atmosphere,the protagonist and his life were explained in an indirect way but it was nevertheless so detailed that I felt like I was in a post-apocalyptic California. 

The protagonist's past life was shrouded in mystery in the beginning. The story itself progressed like layers,first we get to know how he scavenges for supplies and barricades himself at night. His intricate tactics to protect himself at night and his gradual descent into insanity upon realising that he was alone was so meticulously written by the author that I was like ""woah"" then gradually we get to discover his godforsaken past, his family, how the vampires were created the government's cruel ways to curb it and the religious superstition that were formed along were explained not in one go but slowly, which gave a sense of satisfaction as I got to know more about him

What stood out to me the most was the scientific explanation for vampires. You see, instead of zombies in the movies, which I later learned there was one after googling it after read the book, there were vampires. When the protagonist regained his senses he began to learn more and more about them. All the mythological aspects of vampires like their fear of the Cross and garlic and how they were vulnerable in daytime were supported with a scientific explanation which was like, way ahead of it's time. Remember this book was published almost 60 years ago. To be daring enough to take a new path in the sci fi genre was one of the things that made me love the author.

My only gripe was with the ending. The story had been slowly progressing like a roller coaster of emotions and just when it reached it's peak, it plummeted down. They author intoduced a new ""faction""(not spoiling it though) which I felt,was rushed up. The ending however, despite being sad, had a deep moral behind it- ""when the entire world is ruled by chaos, never trust a man as the values that make humans, humans are thrown out of the window."" This was what I learned at the end.

Last but not the least, after learning that the movie featured zombies instead of the vampires that were crafted with scientific research by the author, I feet this as a betrayal to the book and the author's legacy. I vowed never to see the movie.

Are light novels still considered novels? 

For those who don't know light novels are basically Japanese novels with some very limited illustrations. They're usually shorter than conventional novels and the plot is usually extended over several volumes. 

I feel like i enjoy light novels more than conventional novels. There's just something very different about the way they're written. They don't feel overly atmospheric or in a way full of themselves, like they aren't novels. They feel more personal like your reading an overly long letter from friend if that makes sense.   

My favorite author is Nishio Ishin, author of the monogatari series and his works are fascinating. Especially his characters The way they talk and behave. They don't feel real, but that does't take away from the enjoyment at all, in fact the opposite. He could spend an entire chapter talking nonsense about someone's panties and yet its still amazing. The plot also seems to revolve about something and nothing at the same time and in the end everything just seems to resolve itself. His works give off the feeling of being extremely lazy but are in fact genius. To me they feel like a fairy tale, and his characters feel bubbly if that makes sense.  

Another light novel is the ""Empty Box and the Zeroth Maria"" series which is also amazing in its own right for being tightly woven and extremely clever.

If anyone has read a light novel please let me know how you would compare them to conventional novels and how they're different and why you think its ok for them to operate under different rules and still end up enjoyable.

Now after a bit of a reading hiatus i find myself enjoying and getting into it again but i can't feel it anymore no matter how many different books i've read since.
I finished Dune today for example and i really loved the story i was in from start to finish binging it in less than two days and couldn't wait to see what happens but now that it's over i just don't feel like i was in the desert with them you know, it's just like someone told me a great story but i didn't live it with these fictional friends, i didn't feel sad when some of them died, i just felt the wow effect of surprise but no emotion.

I can't tell if i'm depressed or if getting older makes you feel less.
I have a good life with someone that's a perfect lifelong match for me so i'm really starting to think of the latter.

The world itself is fascinating, being similar to a late 1700's Venice and while technically a fantasy setting, the fantasy elements add a layer of mystery and wonder to the world without subtracting from the realistic design and feel of the city in which the novel takes place.

One of my favourite aspects is how intelligence and scheming is given far more importance than fighting capability! I love how the main character is far more akin to a mastermind than the typical prophecy hero that I have seen more often nowadays, and yet he isn't the only person in the city with their own agenda, as each and every person in the novel tries to better their own lot in life! Its phenomenally written, as each persons plans interlock into a giant web of schemes and lies!

Something I am particularly impressed by is the side characters! They are all extremely well written, each being completely believable and relatable on some level, and their individual personalities matching the life choices they have made and the positions they have been put in! I really love the chemistry as well, especially between our characters main group The Gentleman Bastards, as their respective attitudes and dialogue play off each other extremely well!

Perhaps my favourite little sidebit about this novel is the magic. While their is some magic, it exists entirely to screw with the main character, which is something I personally have never seen, but wish I could see more of!

All in all, I can't recommend this novel enough! If you're looking for a breath of fresh air; something that remains in the fantasy genre but takes a far more realistic approach, then The Lies of Locke Lamora is a book that you need to check out!

S. Ramachandran. Fascinating book and super interesting to read. He recounts how his work with patients who have bizarre neurological disorders has shed new light on the deep architecture of the brain, and what these findings tell us about who we are, how we construct our body image, why we laugh or become depressed, why we may believe in God, how we make decisions, deceive ourselves and dream, perhaps even why we're so clever at philosophy, music and art. Some of his most notable cases are explored. Ramachandran is well-known and has a lot of popular readings, if you enjoy this work or the subject in general. I am not personally familiar with Sandra Blakeslee or any of her other works.

Another favorite from Ramachandran is *The Tell-Tale Brain: A Neuroscientist's Quest for What Makes Us Human* - where he ""investigates strange, unforgettable cases―from patients who believe they are dead to sufferers of phantom limb syndrome. With a storyteller’s eye for compelling case studies and a researcher’s flair for new approaches to age-old questions, Ramachandran tackles the most exciting and controversial topics in brain science, including language, creativity, and consciousness.""

Secondly, another great author on this subject, who is also prolific and well-known/respected in neuroscience, would be Oliver Sacks. He may be more popular even, as he is/was both a great scientist, but also a great narrative storyteller. He has a lot of great books published, and they are very easy to read. It's a scientific subject, but a very human perspective in discussing the cases and his patients. 

If you like this subject matter and want to dig into such but with a narrative format, rather than more textbook-esque information - check out Ramachandran, as well as Oliver Sacks' books. They are incredible really, and they both have many popular books on varying topics in the field. I have read more Sacks myself, so I'll list some of my favorites here as well:

*The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat* - ""tells the stories of individuals afflicted with fantastic perceptual and intellectual aberrations: patients who have lost their memories and with them the greater part of their pasts; who are no longer able to recognize people and common objects; who are stricken with violent tics and grimaces or who shout involuntary obscenities; whose limbs have become alien; who have been dismissed as retarded yet are gifted with uncanny artistic or mathematical talents.""

*Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain* - ""In Musicophilia, he shows us a variety of what he calls “musical misalignments.” Among them: a man struck by lightning who suddenly desires to become a pianist at the age of forty-two; an entire group of children with Williams syndrome, who are hypermusical from birth; people with “amusia,” to whom a symphony sounds like the clattering of pots and pans; and a man whose memory spans only seven seconds-for everything but music.""

*Hallucinations* - ""To many people, hallucinations imply madness, but in fact they are a common part of the human experience. These sensory distortions range from the shimmering zigzags of a visual migraine to powerful visions brought on by fever, injuries, drugs, sensory deprivation, exhaustion, or even grief. Hallucinations doubtless lie behind many mythological traditions, literary inventions, and  religious epiphanies. Drawing on his own experiences, a wealth of clinical cases from among his patients, and famous historical examples ranging from Dostoevsky to Lewis Carroll, the legendary neurologist Oliver Sacks investigates the mystery of these sensory deceptions: what they say about the working of our brains, how they have influenced our folklore and culture, and why the potential for hallucination is present in us all.""

The Japanese know how to die. That might seem an odd compliment to pay, but it's a sincere one. I'm a longtime admirer of (traditional) Japanese culture; and one of the facets of Japanese culture I admire most is their attitude to death—the restraint, equanimity and, compared to the West, lack of useless striving and pointless melodrama with which they approach the end of life. Nothing illustrates this attitude so well as the Japanese tradition of *jisei*.

As soon as I read Japanese Death Poems by Yoel Hoffman, it became my favourite poetry collection.

I initially became interested in the tradition of jisei through reading the death poems of WWII Kamikaze pilots. This book really opened up the entire world of death poetry to me, and the wider tradition of Zen poetry beside (though unfortunately few of the other Japanese poetry collections I've purchased live up to this one. Maybe it's because they're not about death.)

As someone of a rather depressive persuasion, I think a lot about death—as the Buddha said, ""Do not neglect the recollection of death"", or as the Western tradition has it, ""Memento mori."" I think these poems really show how death, rather than something frightening or ugly, can be just as beautiful as life, and how a life lived in consciousness of the imminence of death can be more beautiful because of it. Because we know that we are about to die, we are able to value our brief, transitory life. We take time to appreciate the evanescent glory of the cherry blossoms. Despite being only twenty-one, this book inspired me to write dozens of death poems of my own (I imagine I'll have a few thousand by the time I actually die—or not.) It's a remarkable exercise, which I think everyone should do. Nothing throws things into relief like the awareness of death. You soon figure out what really matter, and, perhaps more importantly, what doesn't, when you're looking death in the mouth.

Without getting into personal details, this book meant a great deal to me at a very difficult, and rather traumatic, time of my life. I found the honesty with which the Japanese confront death so refreshing—all pretension is stripped away, and one is left alone with the mystery of eternity. This book was genuinely a therapeutic read.

For some the constantly reiterated imagery, deeply-rooted in Japanese Buddhist philosophy, of moon and seasons and flowers, may become repetitive. For me, I think deep truths become more true the more they are repeated, not less. It is the genius of Japanese poetry in general that simplicity conceals profound meaning, meaning which unfolds itself in your mind as you meditate on it. This is not a book to be read in a hurry.

If I quoted all my favourite poems, since I'd end up quoting half the book. Here are just a few:

&gt;The year is ending:  
I have not left my heart behind.  
—Hankai  

&gt;Farewell—and though there be  
no budding in the spring,  
no autumn withering—all is well.  
—Hakusai  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Rise, let us go—  
along the path lies the clear dew.  
—Fujo  
&gt;  
&gt;  
In earth and sky  
no grain of dust—  
snow on the foothills.  
—Chirin  
&gt;  
&gt;  
A cuckoo cries the end—  
clouds on a summer morning.  
—Goshuku  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Though I tarry on the road my master took,  
above us glows one moon.  
—Isaibo  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Man's end,  
a mound of gleaming bones:  
a flowering and a fading.  
—Hamei  
&gt;  
&gt;  
My old body:  
a drop of dew  
grown heavy at the leaf-tip  
—Kiba  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Since I was born  
I must die,  
and so...  
—Kisei  
&gt;  
&gt;  
If I must die  
let it be autumn  
ere the dew is dry.  
—Koyo

If you are at all interested in death, poetry or Japanese culture, buy this book. By all means skip the introduction if you want to get straight to the poems, but just read it. You won't regret it. And maybe, if you take to heart the philosophy of these profoundly wise men, you will be able to face the equally terrifying, equally strange phenomena of death and life without regret, as well.

&gt;To learn how to die,  
watch cherry blossoms,  
observe chrysanthemums

&gt;Tonight, Evelyn Hardcastle will be killed... again.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;It is meant to be a celebration but it ends in tragedy. As fireworks explode overhead, Evelyn Hardcastle, the young and beautiful daughter of the house, is killed.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;But Evelyn will not die just once. Until Aiden – one of the guests summoned to Blackheath for the party – can solve her murder, the day will repeat itself, over and over again. Every time ending with the fateful pistol shot.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;The only way to break this cycle is to identify the killer. But each time the day begins again, Aiden wakes in the body of a different guest. And someone is determined to prevent him ever escaping Blackheath... 

 

This month we will be reading *The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle* by Stuart Turton. 

The dates of and links to the discussion threads can be found in the sticky comment on this post. You are welcome to read at your own pace. Don't worry about joining later on in the month. Usually it is pretty easy to catch up, but you are always welcome to join the discussions a little later.

Stuart Turton will be joining us for an AMA on **Friday, June 28.**

 **The Rules**

 * Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.

 * All suggestions made in this thread must be direct replies to other people's requests. Do not post suggestions in reply to this self-post.

 * All unrelated comments will be deleted in the interest of cleanliness.

 **How to get the best recommendations**

 The most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.

 ____

 All Weekly Recommendation Threads are linked below the header throughout the week to guarantee that this thread remains active day-to-day.  For those bursting with books that you are hungry to suggest, the suggested sort is new; you may need to do this manually if your app or settings means this does not happen for you.

 If this thread has not slaked your desire for tasty book suggestions, we propose that you head on over to the aptly named subreddit /r/suggestmeabook.

Really? But by far the worst part of it to me is the protagonist. He's such a gargantuan Mary Sue. And I know that's an overused term, but this is textbook. His life story is based on the author's. He's great at everything and just picks up like 3 languages over the course of the book. He's *so* good at fighting but he's also such a good guy that he never kills anybody. Literally every character loves him. They're practically falling over themselves to tell him what a great guy he is. He's chosen by the mysterious spiritual gangster character. He's part of the mafia so you know he's super tough and dangerous, but he's also such a great guy he's always a little bit set apart because he's not like those BAD mafia guys. Women want him and men want to be him. He's brave, tough, smart, dangerous, kind. Relax dude, an actual flaw wouldn't hurt.

And I won't even get to into the pseudo-philosophical faff that fills it. Long pages of discussion, aka the author shoving his half baked ideas that don't really make any sense down your throat.

Hi, I don't want to exclude anyone from commenting, but since I'd especially like to hear from guys, I'm going to address my message to them. I will appreciate comments from anyone!

I'm a woman, and I love a good love story. But guys, don't you like love, too? You fall in love in real life. Do you not want to read love stories, and if so, why not? Do you feel like love stories aren't published (by this I mean written and marketed) with you in mind? Maybe you do like to read love stories, and I'm just ignorant. To me, it seems that love stories are published based on the idea that love is for women and the LGBTQ community. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with that. I'm happy we have love stories, and people love to read them. I'm just curious why we have this idea that guys don't want or like to read them. Is it true?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;REVISED TITLE: Do guys read love stories?&lt;/h1&gt;

*No life story with a happy ending to tell, only a contrivance of horror, then nothingness—and nothing else.*

*No free will-to-live, no redemption by a will-to-die, how depressing.*

*No philosophies to peddle, pessimism a no-sale, optimism had to close its doors, too wicked to pass code.*

*No mechanisms or mind-games, repressional mechanisms broke down, self-deception shuttered its windows.*

*No awakening from a dream within a dream, mutation of consciousness—parent of all horrors, best not mess with it, extinction looking better all the time.*

*No more pleasure, what there was of it, a few crumbs left by chaos at feast, still a good supply of pain though.*

*No praiseworthy incentives, just bowel-movement pressures, potato-mashing relativism.*

*No euthanasia, bad of the business of life, you're on your own here, but watch out for the eternal return, most horrible idea in the universe.*

*No loving God, omnipotence off duty and omniscience on leave, the deity: He, dead—the horror, the horror, even the skies of spring and the flowers of summer must ever afterward be poison, blame it on the piecing together of dissociated knowledge.*

*No compassionate Buddha, body snatchers got him, heard tell, or some kind of thing, maybe next lifetime.*

*No Good-versus-Evil formulas around here, Azathoth running the show, human beings a mistake or joke, something pernicious making a nightmare of our world.*

*No being normal and real, the uncanny coming at you full speed, startling and dreadful.*

*No ego-death—enlightenment by accident.*

*No way out of harm's way, better never to have been, worst saved for last.*

*No Last Messiah, buried in the fingernails of midwives and pacifier makers, gone the way of messiahs past.*

It would please me if you take the money and use it for some kindly purpose. Buy meals for poor children or donate copies of the magazine to those who cannot afford to buy them or whatever your good heart tells you to do.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, however, do not take this as a precedent for other American writers. Some American writers do travel and might   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;intend to visit Poland and might be able to use such money very well. And may the time come when all nations will be friends and all peoples will be one.&lt;/p&gt;

+ Trust (kind of similar to my first point) in certain bookstores about their selection.

+ Have uniqueness. For instance, a store in New Orleans were selling cuisine related books which I absolutely loved. Speaking with the owners personally taught me different perspectives about different subjects (e.g. cooking)

+ B&amp;N offers a wider range of international options especially in magazines. For instance, I was able to find physical copies of UK based magazines (You can technically find Kindle versions but reading in paper is different)

- Pricier but you receive it immediately (not a huge problem if you have Amazon Prime)

- Wider the bookstore/ franchise it feels more bland.

Online shopping
+ Cheap (unless you are paying for Prime)

+ Easy to read (especially with Kindle books)

While I do agree that this does not give you any idea what the book is about, I think it does a better job at telling you whether you will enjoy the book or not, which is why I want to defend it. I know the creator of the original post said that mainly nonficion books have this issue, but it is still present in fiction, and as I do not have any nonfiction books with this issue present at the moment, I do have examples from fiction books.  

When I picked up *The First Law* trilogy by Joe Abercrombie, the first thing to greet me was praise from George R. R. Martin saying ""Joe Abercrombie is doing some terrific work."" Similarly, when I picked up *The Cold Commands* by Richard Morgan, I saw a quote comparing Morgan to Abercrombie, and then a quote from Abercrombie himself endorsing Morgan. Even though both *The Blade Itself* and *The Cold Commands* have synopses, I didn't have more than a single glance at either before reading the books. I enjoyed both, and entered them without knowing anything about either except that they most likely right up my alley since they are endorsed by authors whom I trust. Authors I've read and at least somewhat enjoyed, whose words I respect. It was the was the same when I picked up *The Wise Man's Fear* by Patrick Rothfuss and saw a genuine review from Brandon Sanderson, as well when I picked up *Nevernight* by Jay Kristoff which (on my edition) has personal praise from Rothfuss. I haven't finished either of those two, but I have enjoyed them immensely thus far. And again, I believe that they're telling the truth, simply because it seems like they've actually read the book, and wanted to write a review about it.

There are also examples of books I've bought for the synopses and now that I've read them, I wish I'd read their praise first. The easiest examples to bring up are Sarah J. Maas' *Throne of Glass* and its prequel, *The* *Assassin's Blade*. The premise of an assassin that has lost everything and is given another shot at life but has to fight for it sounds amazing! And without turning this post into a criticism of the *Throne of Glass* series, I'll condense it into one sentence: what I found most enjoyable was criticizing it. The prequels were even worse as its synopsis is simply wrong, but that is something I found out while reading the thing. However, another thing I noticed while reading the prequels is that it has a page for praise, and none of them are really saying what is good about the series except for ""the plot is riddled"" and ""enthralling, thrilling and beautiful."" These sentences aren't really specific for *Throne of Glass* and could be copy-pasted onto another book without anyone really noticing. While on the other hand, what Sanderson says about *Wise Man's Fear* are precise ideas that couldn't and wouldn't be plastered to just any book.

One last example is actually my personally favourite book: *The Silmarillion* by John R. R. Tolkien. My copy has a synopsis that could simply be a random praise, but a praise that is printed right below the synopsis, is from The Guardian and asks ""How, given little over half a century, did one man become the creative equivalent of a people?"" That quote alone is the majority of the concept of what I recommend about Tolkien when I get the chance to recommend his work. How beautifully it's written, and how wonderfully rich his world is. I don't recommend *The Silmarillion* because it's the ""legendary precursor to The Lord of the Rings"" like the synopsis says.

So where am I headed with all this? Well, to give a short conclusion: praise may not always tell you what the book is about, but with experience it can tell you whether it's a book you'll like. Of course, there are exceptions: some books you'll like and some books you won't, regardless of synopsis or praise. But even so, how I treat it is if the book only has the simple ""breathtaking,"" then unless that's from a source I can trust or respect, then there really isn't anything to give praise to and I might as well just continue on my list instead.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently saw &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/c0juw9/an_irritating_publishing_trend/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x""&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; (titled: &lt;em&gt;An irritating publishing trend&lt;/em&gt;) bringing attention to the topic regarding publishers not printing a synopsis on the back of books, instead printing reviews that may simply say &amp;quot;breathtaking.&amp;quot; While I do agree that this does not give you any idea what the book is about, I think it does a better job at telling you whether you will enjoy the book or not, which is why I want to defend it.

2. I hate Ana. I don’t care how insensitive I sound and hopeful people will agree with me. She’s a wasted character and I find her annoying.

Ready Player One book and movie are essentially two completely different stories set in the same universe, with many different references to the 80s. Likely, when they made the movie they had to change a few things up, because even though the book is from 2011, some things were already outdated (e.g. in the book they still write blogs, while in the movie players are on twitch). Also I find that the movie references more well-known geek artifacts, as opposed to the book that focuses a lot on old arcade games that many younger people probably never heard of (among many, many other 80s references).

In sum, the two are vastly different experiences, so it is definitely worth to check out both. I actually find it hard to compare the versions entirely, because of how different they are. Only one things that really bugged me in the movie version: The bad guys are more of a joke you're supposed to laugh at, while in the novel, they are actually a scary vision of a corporate-controlled future, in which capital surpasses the value of a human life (if we haven't already reached that future!). On the other hand, though, I really loved the actor they chose for Halliday. He has the perfect voice for both an awkward real-life geek guy, and the wizard avatar Anorak. I felt like it greatly enriched my imagination of that character when I read the book (first watched the film, then read the book, then watched film again).

Anyway, what's you guys' opinion on the book and movie, or about reading a book that has a film adaptation?

Edit: You can have whichever opinion you like on it, you're free to hate it :) but downvoting for not sharing your opinion on a book is a bit weird (in reference to the comments, not to this post)

Edit 2: Thanks for the interesting discussion. It seems like RP1 is a book you either deeply hate or love. I agree it is not an extraordinary piece of literature, it reads more like YA fiction (though I doubt that's the audience).

But i decided to give the first few chapters a read anyway, and good heavens, it is marvelous.

Reading through all the written etiquette makes you wonder where it all went, in just 100 years, it has all but vanished, the carefully laid rules of ones life, not heeded anymore.

Throughout it gives you etiquette and rules of politeness thou must follow, even little things, like giving your lady the right-hand seat on your carriage, something that does not exactly apply to today's motorcars, but it will make you think the next time a lady will be traveling in your vehicle, shall you or not, give the lady the right-hand seat? 

Chapter after chapter you will feel that you have been writing the wrong way, talking to people the wrong way, greeting wrong, and doing nearly everything wrong.

It not as so brainwashes you on how to live, but rather the messages conveyed go deep into your mind, into your heart, where they will forever be respected, you will want to bow down to all your friends, be helpful to ladies and fellow gentlemen, you will not want to brag about your new luxury car, not after you read this book anyway.

It will also make you think of the rudeness and impoliteness around you, all the things in the book that it claims to be ""indicative of ill-breeding"" can be found in everyday life, out in public, at the diner, everywhere, and certainly most of the written etiquette that does not apply today can be skipped, but not all of it, most of it still applies and is very important to modern living, and it certainly is sad to think that knowledge and use of these written rules is waning, some may disagree, and while gentlemen are often laughed at, it certainly is a perfect time to be a gentlemen, and you can do it all for free, in this one book.


It also explains some examples of etiquette gone wrong

&gt; In countries where royalty rules the etiquette, it often happens that pride will blind those who make the rules, and the results are often fatal. Believing that the same deference which their rank authorized them to demand, was also due to them as individuals, the result of such an idea was an etiquette as vain and useless as it was absurd.

&gt; For an example I will give an anecdote:

&gt; “The kings of Spain, the proudest and vainest of all{35} kings of the earth, made a rule of etiquette as stupid as it was useless. It was a fault punishable by death to touch the foot of the queen, and the individual who thus offended, no matter under what circumstances, was executed immediately.

&gt; “A young queen of Spain, wife of Charles the Second, was riding on horseback in the midst of her attendants. Suddenly the horse reared and threw the queen from the saddle. Her foot remained in the stirrup, and she was dragged along the ground. An immense crowd stood looking at this spectacle, but no one dared, for his life, to attempt to rescue the poor woman. She would have died, had not two young French officers, ignorant of the stupid law which paralyzed the Spaniards, sprung forward and saved her. One stopped the horse, and whilst he held the bridle, his companion disengaged from its painful position the foot of the young queen, who was, by this time, insensible from fear and the bruises which she had already received. They were instantly arrested, and while the queen was carried on a litter to the palace, her young champions were marched off, accompanied by a strong guard, to prison. The next day, sick and feeble, the queen was obliged to leave her bed, and on her knees before the king, plead for the pardon of the two Frenchmen; and her prayer was only granted upon condition that the audacious foreigners left Spain immediately.”

&gt; There is no country in the world where the absurdities of etiquette are carried to so great a length as in Spain, because there is no nation where the nobility are so{36} proud. The following anecdote, which illustrates this, would seem incredible were it not a historical fact:

&gt; “Philip the Third, king of Spain, was sick, and being able to sit up, was carefully placed in an arm chair which stood opposite to a large fire, when the wood was piled up to an enormous height. The heat soon became intolerable, and the courtiers retired from around the king; but, as the Duke D’Ussede, the fire stirrer for the king, was not present, and as no one else had the right to touch the fire, those present dared not attempt to diminish the heat. The grand chamberlain was also absent, and he alone was authorized to touch the king’s footstool. The poor king, too ill to rise, in vain implored those around him to move his chair, no one dared touch it, and when the grand chamberlain arrived, the king had fainted with the heat, and a few days later he died, literally roasted to death.”

So, I'll admit, this post will be just kind of a vent, but I also want to hear if anyone else has experienced something similar. During my freshmen year of college I spent many hours reading, annotating, and just really digging into a copy of ""IT"" that I'd bought the summer before. It was the first book I've really read non-stop, I mean, for hours on end and hundreds of pages on end. Considering the themes of the book, it was a really neat read as I was right on the crux between being a teenager and an adult. I really got a lot from the book and it was a great experience to read it. I annotate all the books I read because I want to be able to go back and experience them again, what I found in them at that point in my life, how it felt to read them for the first time. Unfortunately, I've been looking for my copy of IT recently and just can't find it. I'm beginning to think I may have left it back in my dorm room at the end of my freshman year - I was so sleep-deprived and exhausted that I ended up leaving an entire painting print (that had great sentimental value, mind you - thankfully I was able to recover that) on the wall when I left, so it certainly isn't out of the realm of possibility. Chances are it's lying around somewhere, but I just will be bummed out if it's not. I'm a pretty sentimental person and I tend to attach feeling to pretty much any old object, and it's probably a vice I should learn to temper, but eh. 

Anyways, this whole thing has got me thinking about why people annotate their books and the attachments people form with them. Why do you annotate your books, or, if you don't, why not? Do you prefer to find old copies with other people's annotations (I like to do this too...)? Do you find that annotating distracts you from the experience of reading or enhances it?

Burroughs is a complex novella that explores a man so far outside of society that he wanders through it as though separated by common decency by a screen. This book is semi-autobiographical and follows Lee (Burroughs) as he floats around Mexico and South America in search of sexual conquests and feeding his addictions while suffering heroin withdrawal.

While book may seem tame by modern standards, there are no graphic depictions of sex, the mere fact that this novel openly talks about homosexual relationships made it quite controversial for the 1950s (although not published until the mid 80s). Throughout the novel Burroughs uses many slurs and derogatory descriptions of homosexuals and mexicans. This is not only a sign of the times and attitudes in which the book was written but also the authors complicated feelings of sadness and self loathing.

Queer is more simple than some of Burroughs later work but there are definitely some hints to the strangeness and haunting writing that was ahead of him.

While it is easy to project judgement on Burroughs and his fictional alter ego Lee I think it is missing the point as he has no intention of making his life or any of the stories contained in Queer to be palatable or moral. He isn't seeking out approval, he is documenting his reality. 

I have read Queer many times and this time it really struck me how sadness permiates the work. The surface interpreation of Lee as a predator, and degenerate drug addict is valid but I also really appreciated the underlying sadness, and self hatred that seem to be at Lee's core. This of course to notr absolve or forgive him but it gives me a greater understanding. Lee's seeking of sex is a mask and a cheap way to try and find human connection. As an outsider, he cannot get people to relate to him easily so he turns to sex when he is looking for human companionship


&gt;He put one arm across Allerton's chest and snuggled close to the boy's body. A feeling of deep tenderness flowed out from Lee's body at the warm contact. He snuggled closer and stroked Allerton's shoulder gently. Allerton moved irritably, pushing Lee's arm away.
""Slack off will you, and go to sleep,"" said Allerton. He turned on his side, with his back to Lee. Lee drew his arm back. His whole body contracted with shock. Slowly he put his hand under his cheek. He felt a deep hurt, as though he were bleeding inside. Tears ran down his face.

It was really dark when you look back. Though as a kid i just cared about the progression, you really appreciate how dark it was once you look back on it.

&amp;#x200B;

The series had an interesting enough premise. The book was about kids who could use morphing technology to change into different animals to fight off an alien invasion of slug-like aliens. These slugs were waging a silent invasion on earth in order to capture hosts and take over their brains/bodies. They could be inside anyone, even your mom and dad, who are trapped in their own brain as the Yerk inside them plotted on you next.

&amp;#x200B;

(SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT)

&amp;#x200B;

First... The book was violent and graphic from the start. It featured and was aimed at 13 year olds. Very graphic stories of bodies being torn limb from limb, feeling yourself dying, blood gushing from what was left of your torn body as you slip awayyyy

&amp;#x200B;

But it was so much more then that.  It showed you what can happen in war.

&amp;#x200B;

The kids started off not wanting to be the monsters. They said they wanted to fight them, not become them. But oh, how war can change even a child.  They were 13 when the war started, 16 when it ended.

&amp;#x200B;

At first, they did not want to kill at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Then... They limited it to not killing humans.

&amp;#x200B;

Then it was.  ""We don't kill humans who are running away.""

&amp;#x200B;

Then it was ""We don't kill prisoners""

&amp;#x200B;

Then it was ""We kill all enemies on sight""

&amp;#x200B;

That turned into ""We kill anyone who slows us down, we don't care who they are""

&amp;#x200B;

Then it was ""We do kill prisoners.  In fact, we will black mail you about it"".

&amp;#x200B;

Next. Threats of Mass murder and destruction. Innocents included. Anything or anyone near the target.

&amp;#x200B;

Next. Mass murder and destruction. Innocents included. Anything or anyone near the target.

&amp;#x200B;

Next. Mass murder of helpless prisoners as a distraction. Or.. just because the Animorph leader was having a bad day.

&amp;#x200B;

Next? Send your closest family member to kill your other closest family member. As a distraction. (They both die.)

&amp;#x200B;

Next?  Tell yourself about how you are the good guy, so you would never turn into another human using your morphing powers without their permission.

&amp;#x200B;

Next?  Steal some hospitalized guy's blood from his body so you can use your morphing power to turn into a human without his permission.

&amp;#x200B;

Next?  Woo handicapped children to fight for your guerrilla army. By promising them the power to get out of, and maybe even heal their handicapped bodies, using the morphing process.

&amp;#x200B;

Next? Order the handicapped children to kill a bunch of giant worms. Make the children de-morph exposed in open combat, and flop around helpless in their natural handicapped bodies, in order to turn into dangerous animals to kill almost helpless giant worms who were sentient and mostly slaves themselves, and to themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

Next?  Order the handicapped children to commit suicide via being incinerated one by one. By attacking a powerful flying spaceship as tigers and bears. As a distraction.  (Berate them and peer pressure them when they get scared)

&amp;#x200B;

And lets not forget... Force a ""dog-life-force-giving"" android pacifist with incredible strength and technological ability to assist in killing by threatening to kill as many prisoners as it took. As a distraction.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh... And have most of the main cast most likely die in a suicide attack at the end of the book. Cliff-Hanger.

&amp;#x200B;

(From commentators who refreshed my memory.)

&amp;#x200B;

Also: Convinced a kid to join them as an ally in the war. Trapped him for life as a rat when he could not handle it. Made him beg to die.

&amp;#x200B;

Also: Make allies with a friendly pre-historic earth based alien race. Trick them. Make them go extinct. And take their weapon to save themselves instead.

&amp;#x200B;

Also: Made a kind-hearted pacifist android fall into deep depression by forcing him to live an eternity with the memories of tearing living creatures apart.

....

&amp;#x200B;

Ya...

&amp;#x200B;

The book also discussed numerous social controversies, romance during war, and was a clever read, and made me laugh more then any other book with its humor. It was a heck of a book series.

&amp;#x200B;

Wanted to get to state this book series may have a bit of a ""childish"" writing ideology at the surface, but is a good read, and has great progression of its story and characters. It has a very detailed world. I recommend it.

&lt;p&gt;Also: Make allies with a friendly pre-historic earth based alien race. Trick them. Make them go extinct. And take their weapon to save themselves instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also: Made a kind-hearted pacifist android fall into deep depression by forcing him to live an eternity with the memories of tearing living creatures apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ya...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book also discussed numerous social controversies, romance during war, and was a clever read, and made me laugh more then any other book with its humor. It was a heck of a book series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wanted to get to state this book series may have a bit of a &amp;quot;childish&amp;quot; writing ideology at the surface, but is a good read, and has great progression of its story and characters. It has a very detailed world. I recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shout out to anyone who remembers the Visser Chronicles. Nobody has mentioned it out of all the comments here yet!&lt;/p&gt;

During this time Weir actually wrote his first novel, *Theft of Pride*, which he only published on the internet as far as I can tell.

After Casey &amp; Andy ended Weir went on to do a fantasy webcomic project titled *Cheshire Crossing* about the further adventures of Dorothy Gale, Wendy Darling, and Alice Liddel. It's basically X-men for Victorian children's fantasy and I personally consider it very well written, but unfortunately the art was still extremely mediocre and the comic didn't get very much attention.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm starting a buddy reading group for YA Fantasy Books and I'm looking for members! This group is meant to encourage people to keep reading and have discussions every so often about the books.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm starting with the Throne of Glass series - a popular series by Sarah J. Maas.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a bit about the first book (from Goodreads):

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After serving out a year of hard labor in the salt mines of Endovier for her crimes, 18-year-old assassin Celaena Sardothien is dragged before the Crown Prince. Prince Dorian offers her her freedom on one condition: she must act as his champion in a competition to find a new royal assassin.  


Her opponents are men-thieves and assassins and warriors from across the empire, each sponsored by a member of the king's council. If she beats her opponents in a series of eliminations, she'll serve the kingdom for four years and then be granted her freedom. Celaena finds her training sessions with the captain of the guard, Westfall, challenging and exhilarating. But she's bored stiff by court life. Things get a little more interesting when the prince starts to show interest in her ... but it's the gruff Captain Westfall who seems to understand her best.  


Then one of the other contestants turns up dead ... quickly followed by another. Can Celaena figure out who the killer is before she becomes a victim? As the young assassin investigates, her search leads her to discover a greater destiny than she could possibly have imagined.

This post is going to be spoiler heavy so if you haven’t read East of Eden yet and you still want to, stop reading now.

This is going to be one big rant but I don’t know any other people irl who have read the book, and I had to air my frustrations somewhere, so I hope you will not find me too insufferable here.

A few years ago I’ve read East of Eden and I was blown away. I fell in love with the characters. I felt that the themes were extremely obvious but somehow it felt beautifully done. The book is so interspersed with these magnificent nuggets of wisdom and reflections on the human condition that I actually felt like I knew a little more about life after having read it.

A few weeks ago I’ve read it again and I’ve been feeling frustrated with it. The reason for it is that as I read it again something stood out to me and the book simply doesn’t seem to realize this, and in fact, almost pretends the opposite of this is the case. So here is my frustration:

Adam Trask is a pitiful loser without any redeeming qualities. There, I’ve said it. Let’s go over some key points in his life story.

He is raised by Cyrus, who blatantly favors him over his brother Charles. This culminates in an episode where a teenage Charles attempts to murder him, after which his father sends him off to join the military. Granted, that’s pretty traumatic and not something he so far could do a whole lot about. 

When he is in the military he ends up exchanging letters with his brother and they end up warming up to each other. He tells his brother he is coming home. Halfway on his way home he decides to reverse his decision and rejoins the military. He never informs his brother until years later, and only contacts him again when he needs Charles to help him out financially. (Hi, I didn’t bother writing to you for years even though you were expecting me to come home but can I borrow $100?)

When he finally returns home they find out their father died and the inheritance is enough to ensure they never have to work another day in their life. Adam consequently never does. 

Cathy comes washing up on their doorstep and Adam is immediately smitten. In the book this is often referred to as love, but it obviously is something different: infatuation. Adam is such a bad judge of character that he can’t see what everybody around him instantly notices: Cathy is the devil. 

Adam decides to move to California. Cathy says she doesn’t want to. He ignores her wishes and forces her to move. He buys a mansion with a large plot of land. Cathy doesn’t want to live there, but he decides that she’ll warm up to it. She never does. After Cathy delivers Charles’ twin baby boys she wants to leave. She is literally forced to shoot him before he lets her go.

For someone who truly loves another, he cares remarkably little about her wishes or even the things she literally tells him.

Adam sinks into a depression and withdraws into a dark hole. He didn’t name his twins for over an entire year, and then only did it because Sam beats the shit out of him. He neglects to care *about* them for 10 more, and even after that, he never *takes care of them* period. After 10 years he suddenly pretends to be their parent. We see this through his conversations with Lee, and he is surprised that they actually have characters of their own. He never actually starts to care about their inner life though. 

Adam gets over his depression by confronting Cathy. In their confrontation he somehow gets the upper hand by telling her that she is missing something. She doesn’t understand love, and he does. Except Adam is utterly incapable of loving anybody. After this confrontation Adam supposed he is cured(*yeah I was depressed for 10 years but I’m certain that after one talk everything will be fine from now*) and he tries to send Lee away as soon as he gets home. Thankfully, Lee declines, because without him everybody would be dead within a week.

Adam has no conception of money or work. He inherits a shit ton of money and lives off of that for the rest of his life. At one point he decides to gamble most of it away on a stupid project that everybody tells him is going to fail. Turns out, it fails, and he requires Lee to tally up the bills to see if he was even able to afford it in the first place.

I find it utterly unbelievable that Aaron and Cal would care about what this weak, absent minded, completely helpless and utterly self absorbed man would think about them. But they do.

In his relationship with his sons he shows blatant favoritism toward Aron. As does everybody except for Lee. Just like as in his relationship with Cathy he completely oblivious to who Aron is. He doesn’t care. In his world Aron is everything that’s good and everything that’s good is Aron. Evidence to the contrary be damned. 

All his imagination about what is bad he projects into his relationship with Cal. In fact the only moment he sort-of connects to Cal is when that idea is confirmed when he has to pick Cal up from the police station. When Cal tries to gain his appreciation by doing what Adam is incapable of, making money, doing something useful, he admonished him and accuses him of stealing it. He basically tells Cal he is an asshole for making money during a war.

Alright, so by now we have a clear picture: Adam is a narcissistic asshole who confuses his obsessions with his imagination of certain people with knowing, caring about and loving those people. He is incapable of doing anything useful, both for himself and others and the one thing in life he actually does fails miserably. 

This is where I get annoyed. Lee is a wise man, understanding, capable. He grasps psychology. He is capable of love. But then Lee reflects upon Adam as follows when talking to Cal:

&gt; I think in him kindness and conscience are so large that they are almost faults.

I’m sorry, what? There must be a hell of a lot happening off screen because there is nothing in the book that would warrant such a statement.
 
He goes on to say:

&gt; He’s not smart in a worldly sense but he’s a good man. Maybe the best man I have ever known.

I’m sorry Lee but you have lost your fucking mind?

It's pretty frequently discussed in science fiction circles as it extends into a far greater and wider universe, and even won both a Hugo and a Nebula. 

So I can't help but wonder why this book is so painfully difficult to read.

I don't want to get into a synopsis or finer details of everything that bothered me about it, because that might take more time to type than I have, so I'll keep it more brief. 

Louis Wu, the story's protagonist. 200 years old, but with the health and body of a 30 year-old man. Interesting enough, but what does Niven do with it? Nothing at all, besides use it in a few specific scenarios where he out-wisdoms someone younger and less inexperienced, or comes to ludicrous conclusions through insane jumps of logic that are *ALWAYS* correct. He is sexuality incarnate, and even humanoids of other races find him completely and utterly fuckable, and he finds no moral repercussions in doing just that. I have no qualms with flawed characters, but Louis never changes, and it's never written as though the things Louis does are *bad*, or wrong in any way. He's written to be flawless, and it seems to me like he's Niven's fantasy insert; the man all nerds WISH they could be, sleeping their way through the universe. 

I literally won't even get started on the female characters. And I think the argument ""he's from another time, you have to excuse some of it,"" is complete bullshit. It was the 70's, not the 1800s. Women, even 50 years ago, were viewed as people and not just fleshlights that speak. 

The aliens were so, close to being what Ringworld needed. They don't quite follow Louis's odd trains of thought, and find his practices unusual and often irritating. They're strange and genuinely inhuman, and it's desperately needed to breathe life into the book. Unfortunately, within 50 pages you have already found everything they have to offer. They are flat and static, and immediately become caricatures of themselves. Nessus is calculating and cowardly, and speaker is fierce and proud - but he likes to be scratched behind the ears, and purrs like a cat! How cute, right? 

And my last point: his prose in general. 

Larry Niven somehow managed to consistently make me feel like I was a stupid guy and a bad reader, in two distinct ways.

1. By describing things in ways that were impossible to picture, putting emphasis in strange places, and making unusual features seem mundane. 

2. Describing simple concepts at length like I was reading at a 6th grade level. Repeating things that never needed to be, or hiding inappropriate language, or spelling out every ""revelation"" of the story. 

But the reason all this grated so hard on me is that behind all of this hid a really interesting world, and story that I was truly drawn to. The Ringworld itself holds so much potential, and diving into ideas of determinism clicks on such a deep level. I'm not pissed that I read it, I'm pissed that it could have easily been so much better. 

Through reading this book, I came to the conclusion that it could have been so, so good if Niven had just given the outline to a better writer. 

Anyways, thoughts, opinions? Would love to hear from you guys!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago I read through Ringworld, as I&amp;#39;m a huge fan of science fiction and had been told it&amp;#39;s one of the greats; a classic.

&lt;p&gt;So I can&amp;#39;t help but wonder why this book is so painfully difficult to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to get into a synopsis or finer details of everything that bothered me about it, because that might take more time to type than I have, so I&amp;#39;ll keep it more brief. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Louis Wu, the story&amp;#39;s protagonist. 200 years old, but with the health and body of a 30 year-old man. Interesting enough, but what does Niven do with it? Nothing at all, besides use it in a few specific scenarios where he out-wisdoms someone younger and less inexperienced, or comes to ludicrous conclusions through insane jumps of logic that are &lt;em&gt;ALWAYS&lt;/em&gt; correct. He is sexuality incarnate, and even humanoids of other races find him completely and utterly fuckable, and he finds no moral repercussions in doing just that. I have no qualms with flawed characters, but Louis never changes, and it&amp;#39;s never written as though the things Louis does are &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, or wrong in any way. He&amp;#39;s written to be flawless, and it seems to me like he&amp;#39;s Niven&amp;#39;s fantasy insert; the man all nerds WISH they could be, sleeping their way through the universe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I literally won&amp;#39;t even get started on the female characters. And I think the argument &amp;quot;he&amp;#39;s from another time, you have to excuse some of it,&amp;quot; is complete bullshit. It was the 70&amp;#39;s, not the 1800s. Women, even 50 years ago, were viewed as people and not just fleshlights that speak. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aliens were so, close to being what Ringworld needed. They don&amp;#39;t quite follow Louis&amp;#39;s odd trains of thought, and find his practices unusual and often irritating. They&amp;#39;re strange and genuinely inhuman, and it&amp;#39;s desperately needed to breathe life into the book. Unfortunately, within 50 pages you have already found everything they have to offer. They are flat and static, and immediately become caricatures of themselves. Nessus is calculating and cowardly, and speaker is fierce and proud - but he likes to be scratched behind the ears, and purrs like a cat! How cute, right? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my last point: his prose in general. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Larry Niven somehow managed to consistently make me feel like I was a stupid guy and a bad reader, in two distinct ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;By describing things in ways that were impossible to picture, putting emphasis in strange places, and making unusual features seem mundane. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Describing simple concepts at length like I was reading at a 6th grade level. Repeating things that never needed to be, or hiding inappropriate language, or spelling out every &amp;quot;revelation&amp;quot; of the story. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the reason all this grated so hard on me is that behind all of this hid a really interesting world, and story that I was truly drawn to. The Ringworld itself holds so much potential, and diving into ideas of determinism clicks on such a deep level. I&amp;#39;m not pissed that I read it, I&amp;#39;m pissed that it could have easily been so much better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through reading this book, I came to the conclusion that it could have been so, so good if Niven had just given the outline to a better writer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, thoughts, opinions? Would love to hear from you guys!&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I like books about philosophy and I also like self-books. This new book by Edith Hall, a classics professor at King’s College London, looked promising – sitting at the nexus between philosophy and self-help, using Aristotle’s teachings from 2,500 years ago to “change your life” today. To be honest, I had a lot of trouble getting into it – even though I should have been the book’s target audience. 

I think the biggest reason is that the book was too much about Aristotle and not about how to apply Aristotle’s teachings to contemporary problems. Every now and then, the author will throw in a “I can relate to this because I have a problem with vengeance” or a “I have a friend who’s husband could use this advice,” but it’s all very superficial, and not very in-depth. I do agree 100% with the author that we – as individuals, and as a society – could benefit a lot from Aristotelian logic and ethics. But I already knew that going into the book. So, maybe in that sense, I wasn’t a very good candidate for reading this book – because I already agreed with the premise and didn’t really take anything from it. About the midway point, I figured my time was better spent elsewhere and I returned it to my library. 

I still think this could be a fine book for a very specific audience (maybe people who don’t know a lot about Aristotle and would like to learn more), but that’s admittedly not many people.  Other than that, I’m not really sure anyone else would benefit from it.

To help kick off the discussion:

* Who do you think broke into Lady Hardcastle's Room? Why did they take the guns and the page from the day planner? 

* Should Aidan trust Anna as much as he does? Should he trust his own feelings towards her?

* Why do you think Aidan volunteered to come to Blackheath? Do you think he was fully aware of what he was getting into?

* What do you think Stanwin has on Evelyn?

* What do you consider the most suspicious event so far, but you suspect it has nothing to do with solving the mystery?

* Why do you think Evelyn's unsolved murder deserves such an elaborate manner of solution?

In a post Fifty Shades world, who handled the subject of S&amp;M pretty bad and was just terrible writing, I found Venus in Furs to be very passionate and the author to write extremely well. The way he described all the emotions the characters were feeling and reference characters throughout history so you had a clear cut understanding of the characteristics he was going for is magnificent. 

This book was short and to the point and a emotional rollercoaster because you never could tell if Wanda (Venus) was playing the fantasy or actually being this cruel mistress that the main character begged her to be until the very very end.

I found the book again last week and remembered nothing about it and decided to reread it and loved every single minute of it!&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Since I asked, I'll go first with some of my personal favorites:

1. Lolita (50th Anniversary Edition)

[https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1372767118l/18133.jpg](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1372767118l/18133.jpg)

Like the novel itself, I love how uncomfortable this cover makes me. It's simple on purpose, because the rationale here is all about the context. Just knowing the name of the book, knowing what it's about, completely transforms what would be a pretty ordinary cover into something a lot more uneasy. It makes you feel dirty without doing any overtly perverse, using the infamy of the story to its advantage in order to let the reader essentially creep themselves out. It's a mind-game. Just like the novel.

&amp;#x200B;

2.  1984 (Mass Market Paperback)

[https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348990566l/5470.jpg](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348990566l/5470.jpg)

Okay, so I know that pretty much every single 1984 edition puts the omnipresent eye of Big Brother front and center on the cover (though to be fair, what other opinions are really better?), so why exactly do I prefer this one over the myriad of others? Presentation, I guess. All the other 1984 covers feel too... ominous, I suppose? Too overtly evil. That never really matched with what I really felt was the true terror that made up Big Brother in 1984's first half. It wasn't just the fear that some vague menace could destroy everything you are in one moment, it was that lack of true free-thought. That you really could never be out of Big Bro's eye, anywhere, for the rest of your life. And this simple eye design, almost human looking, always staring, without any sort of overt malice or benevolence, translates that feeling a lot more accurately for me.

&amp;#x200B;

3.  POW! (Seagull Books Hardcover)

[https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1369870252l/15059453.jpg](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1369870252l/15059453.jpg)

I don't really have a lot to say about this one besides that I think it's really damn beautiful. All these different animals illustrated uniquely, surrounding some really slick typography, allowing these wonderful colors to play off each other in order to create one whole theme, it's all pretty mesmerizing. I don't even mind the blurb, because the red of it helps balance out the image even more. I have a pretty mixed opinion on POW! overall, and I know that there isn't any real deeper meaning here, but there doesn't always have to be. It's just pretty. Just meat.

&amp;#x200B;

So please, by all means, share your favorites! I really am looking forward to some of these answers, and the reasons behind them. (If you wish, you can link a book cover by going to its Goodreads page, selecting the Enlarge Cover option, right-click, and select Copy Image Address. Paste that directly in Reddit and you're good to go. If you can't find the edition you want, instead select Other Editions from the Goodreads page, and scroll until you see the one you want. Happy hunting!)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a huge believer that the right cover can really shape an approach or perspective on a novel, I thought I would ask what are some of the best book covers of all time and why.

-

&gt; Mrs. Bancroft’s breasts jiggled with her steps under the thin material of the leotard, and I took a morose interest in the art on the other side of the corridor.

I know it's because the author is trying to portray the though process of the main character, who is obviously focused on this woman's breasts, but it struck me as kind of funny, like ""Then a pair of breasts walked into the room. A head located somewhere above and slightly behind the breasts started saying something or other, which caused the breasts to jiggle a little bit!""

I thought about it and I've noticed that Stephen King sometimes does this too. I remembered when I was reading *Pet Sematary*, thinking it was weird how he kind of randomly started talking about an old woman's breasts:

&gt; It occurred to him that once she had been seventeen, her breasts eyed with great interest by the young men of the neighborhood, all her teeth her own...

Then I wondered how often he talked about breasts in *IT*, so I decided to take a look:

&gt;He struggled halfway up, leaning toward it, and then felt one of Beverly's breasts press against his shoulder as she reached over him to get it.

-

&gt;He stood there for a moment, staring at her as if he had never seen her before. In a way he never had. Her breasts heaved rapidly.

-

&gt;And suddenly—maybe it was because of the utter loathing on her face, the contempt, maybe because she had called him a tub of guts, or maybe only because of the rebellious way her breasts rose and fell—the fear was suffocating him.

-

&gt;It was this latter Beverly who swung the belt for the last time—the belt he had used on her buttocks, her legs, her breasts.

-

&gt;They are in bed together during this conversation. Her breasts are small like peaches, sweet like peaches.

-

&gt;Her hands were folded just below her breasts, as if in prayer.

-

&gt;She clasped her hands together between her budding breasts, fluttered her eyelashes rapidly, and then laughed.

This is where I got bored of this exercise and stopped looking - I was only 30% of the way through!!

So, has anyone else ever noticed this with any authors?

So, I have recently read The Gutter Prayer by Gareth Hanrahan and, although I am in the very small camp of people that didn't like it overall, it didn't help that the book was in present tense.

&amp;#x200B;

I have read books in present tense and liked them before (The Vagrant by Peter Newman for example), however it took a while for me to get into the flow of it. I find that, when I read present tense books, I read much slower than past tense books, along with feeling lost at times and generally disconnected from the narrative as a whole. All of this hinders my enjoyment of the book.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking to read Wolf Hall, which is in present tense, but I am reluctant to buy it then not get on with it due to it's ""tense choice"".

&amp;#x200B;

Is there something that I am missing? Do you guys have any suggestions as to how I can enjoy/appreciate present tense more? Is it just a case of ""you either love it or you hate it""? I just don't want to miss out on amazing works simply because a character does rather than did.

Baby takes us on a journey as she navigates life in a miriad of seedy apartments with her heroin addicted father. Jules is young (he had Baby at 15), barely educated, addicted, and probably has an undiagnosed mental illness. Jules cannot provide for Baby and wouldn't know how to even if he had the means.

The first person narrative is very effective in this kind of story telling as you are not watching from a far and judging Baby's behaviour. You are privvy to her inner most thoughts and motivations for her actions, which gives you a very clear sense of how a young child in her situation is so poorly equipped to handle the adult world she is living in and how easily exploited a child looking for love and belonging can be.

There are many points throughout the book where Baby has the opportunity to change her situation or to make better decisions but she is often forced back into dangerous by things beyond the ability of a young girl. She is left to have to depend on predators because she cannot turn to or trust anyone else.

Lullabies for little Criminals is riveting, Jules is not a good father, he endangers his daughter constantly either unconciously but also at times deliberately yet I couldn't help but feel that there was real love there.

One day Samuel and his daughter were driving into their new house. And on the way they passed a stranger. That stranger had a tattoo. The tattoo was the shape of a tiger. Extending from the arm up to the shoulder. His eyes brown. His hair black. Which is #000000 in code. By the way. His chin sharp. His body fit. His height tall. The stranger has a wife. Four daughters. Two sons. Seven sisters. And one brother. And also two parents. His occupation is being a bartender. By the way. he also has a scar on his cheek. Also by the way. He has a mole beneath his ear and also on his abdomen. Additionally. The guy had a single hair growing from his armpits. And also one on his toe. Just to let you know. Not to mention the fact that his toenail was black in color. 
*Then proceeds to give a backstory to the stranger*

Yeah... that stranger just happened to never ever appear in the story again... just a passerby. No role in the story or whatever. Just wanted to let you know. Also. Many humans have been talking about something called “Comma”. What the hell is a comma? I’ve never heard of it before. I’ve. Researched. For. Seven. Years. But. Still. Can’t. Find out. What. Commas. Are.

Okay, I totally exaggerated this for laughs, I don’t hate Hannah Tinti. I respect her.

If not, this list likely isn't for you. Enjoyment from, and value of books is subjective.

There are some novels which have stuck with me through the years that are only showing up on the most ecclectic of lists and are snubbed on the top searches. I personally greatly enjoyed these books, and if I were a younger person just going off of what google recommended, I never would've read them and I think that's a shame. I know that your mileage may vary, but here are 5 books that I absolutely recommend to read. Even if it's just fuel for thought.

Shogun by James Clavell.

Dune by Frank Herbert.

Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card (also an author with many interesting other novels if you aren't tied to a genre)

Brave New World by Aldous Huxley (for a prescient past perspective on 'future' [current] times)

Tom Jones by Henry Fielding. I know that liking this book is supposed to be a sign of trash people, and perhaps deep down inside I am. However, Tom is a scamp and a rascal and in today's society of rules and regulations, he is more than a breath of fresh air. He's a re-connection with our roots and a kindling of what brings us joy in life on a primal level.

Edit: The response to this has been roughly what I expected when I made the list. That is the entire reason the list was made in the first place. Not because I wanted criticism, but because that is the typical response to these books. However media has been made about all 5 of them, so clearly SOME people love them, even if it's en-vogue to have the opposite response. That to me just makes a list like this that much more important to post.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I have looked at the common &amp;quot;top&amp;quot; lists of books.

Yet over all these years later, it is still by belief that that his greatest masterpiece is Moneyball, and nearly 20 years later, the book has never been more relevant. 

If we look at the greatest works of narrative non-fiction, the subjects are usually war, politics, or disaster. Yet Moneyball created a thriller like page turner with nothing but math and baseball, hardly the most exciting of combinations. 

Yet Lewis, working with that framework, was able to create an absolute classic of a page turner. The fundamental story was simple, it was man versus environment, the story of how Billy Beane fought against the fundamentally inequalities of baseball, how he was able to be competitive against the rich, mighty Yankees with a fifth of their budget. 

Often Moneyball is dismissed as a baseball book, people who aren't baseball fans often tell me that they avoided the book because they won't understand it or that the topic isn't relevant to them. But that is not true at all, Moneyball is actually about a lot more than baseball, and Lewis, to his credit actually very clearly explained all of the jargon. 

The story of Moneyball is a story of a man, staring into the impossible, but instead of giving up, he started to ask why. Beane realized that he can never win against a wealthy, powerful foe as long as the market conditions that created the fundamental inequality still exists. To win, he had to re-examine how baseball worked, and rethink how things happened. 

Moneyball at it's core was never about on base percentage or slugging average. It was never about the statistics that Beane used at the time. It was about his mentality, the idea of re-examining how things were always done, and trying to figure out if it could be done better. 

Here, Lewis pulls off what the vast majority of non-fiction writers struggle with. Routinely brilliant decisions are written off as a stroke of genius, or, as commonly seen in crime procedurals, they wave their hands and use some techno mumbo jumbo. Instead, Lewis puts you into the mind of Billy Beane, and actually explains the thinking that allowed him to pull off what he did. 

This is what the movie really failed to capture. The film just hand waved away the logic and the thinking behind Beane's sabermetrics influenced plan, and instead had a fat nerdy guy just ""do some computer magic"". 

There's a reason why Moneyball is routinely said to be a management classic, and routinely assigned reading in business schools. Because at the core of it, it isn't a baseball book, or statistics book, but a management book. That's why years after every single market inefficiency mentioned in the book has become outdated, Moneyball is still relevant.

The real story of the Oakland A's isn't the statistics that they used, it is the mindset that allowed them to revolutionize a sport. So yes, I believe Moneyball is one of the finest works if narrative non-fiction I have ever read, and is worth a read even if you don't love baseball, even if you don't love statistics and even if you didn't love the movie.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Lewis is a master of narrative non-fiction, and over the years he has writing great works such as Lier&amp;#39;s Poker, The Blind Side, and The Big Short.

Sci-fi, thriller, mistery etc. just doesn't cut it for me because I care much less about the genre than I do about the feel of the book.

1.

I have no idea what proper names for such categories are. Where can I learn to express these?

2. My second issue is that I can't find a good and quick way to find out these facts about books. I usually have to read several reviews, most of which spoil the plot. (I guess I am thinking something along the lines of how fanfiction is tagged, but I could never really get into reading fan-fiction).

3. My third issue is that sites I found that do recommend books based on books that I like are just totally off base. I read *Quadrail* by Timothy Zahn and liked it so I got *The Fifth Season* by N.K. Jemisin recommended on GoodReads, I'm guessing because they are both sci-fi. I can't imagine two more different books than these.

which lets you use sliders for sad/happy, expected/unpredictable and I really liked the idea, but it is very restrictive, you can only use 4 sliders at a time, and has very few books in their database.

The first 100 pages were fantastic. How they defeated Blane the mono was silly yes, but I enjoyed its silliness. This made me get a copy of The Stand because of the chapters in Topeka. Then the next 200 pages... oh boy. The teenage love story between Roland and Susan almost brought me to a breaking point. However, I kept pushing on because I did feel it was well written. I was so hype when the first part of the flashback was over thinking ""Yes! Back to Roland, Eddie, Susannah, and Jake"" Then I saw it was just an interlude.

The second half of the flashback pulled me right back in. I enjoyed watching the plan come together. By the finale I was devastated by Susan's death. I knew the whole book that she was going to die but the pages leading up to it Roland was so confident that she was going to be safe. When Susan escapes with Olive I was thrilled. When they were caught and Olive pulled out the musket I breathed a quick sigh of relief. Then Susan was captured and was torn apart by Susan realizing this was it. For the first time ever I shed a tear while reading.

For the last portion I thought it was kind of strange that it went in the Wizard of Oz direction. If it wasn't bad enough that Roland lost the love of his life in this book we then learn that he also killed his mother. Made me understand Roland on a whole new level.

I've heard from a lot of people that after The Waste Lands the series goes downhill but for me this series is still going strong. Before moving onto the Wolves of the Calla I'm going to read The Little Sisters of Eluria. 

Long Days and Pleasant Nights.

Right now I'm reading Shogun by James Clavell for the second time. It's set during the year 1600, in Japan, and though the POV swivels to different characters, the main fella is named John Blackthorne (inspired by William Adams, the first Englishman to sail to the Japans). The extreme culture-shock he experiences is excellently articulated by Clavell, and his descriptions of Samurai and the Japanese way of life are beautiful (whether they're historically accurate or not I don't know, but that doesn't really matter to this post).  

Now onto my point.  When I first read Shogun, two years ago, I noticed that my discipline in every day life was changing. More exercise, less junk food; more positive thoughts, less seeing the world as unfair to me; more calm, less worry. Clavell's portrayal of Samurai shows them as extremely disciplined people, devoted to a certain way of living that focused on honor, obedience, politeness, and harmony as pillars of a civilized society. Now, I'm not saying I ever felt inclined to commit ritualistic suicide whenever I messed up, but while the character of Blackthorne was adapting to his surroundings, slowly realizing that the English Protestant way of living had many flaws to it, and adopting the more civilized aspects of Japanese life into his own living, I too started to absorb many of the traits I found admirable about the Samurai and other Japanese (and also about Blackthorne himself).  On my second read of the book, the same thing started happening without me noticing - more exercise, more meditation, better diet etc. etc. I'm not saying the Japanese are perfect in the book, I'm just saying that their positive traits were so well written that they affected me in real life, and I really enjoy the feeling  

Another example would be the influence Atticus from To Kill A Mockingbird had on me. Ever since I read that book, Atticus pops into my mind whenever I notice myself judging anyone unfairly.  His total devotion to non-judgement and being an understanding person will probably be always stronger and more ingrained than mine, but the point is that I judge people a lot less now and am probably better off for it.  

The other big one is Kaladin from the Stormlight Archive book one, who's determination and tireless work ethic really made me dig my heels in whenever I felt like giving up on something.

I’ve never posted on here, I always have just lurked, and I have been in love with books ever since I was around 11. I got a Kindle Fire freshman year and never truly fell in love with it. 

I was adamant that I would only ever read books in print and thought ebooks just “were not my *thing*,” when in reality I just had not used the device I needed. The Kindle Paperwhite has literally changed my life. 

As much as I love to read and always have, I can’t even remember the last time I sat down and truly read before getting this Kindle. It had been at least a year, and anytime before when I would try to read my books in print, I didn’t feel that passion to want to read and indulge in a story. I even used to say I always  loved the idea of an e-reader because you could read in the dark, your hand didn’t cramp as easily, storage of multiple books, etc. Anytime I would try to read, typically at night when I’m off work, I’d struggle to read my paper books unless I had all the lights on to keep me awake. And I of course couldn’t read in bed without a book light. But on the other hand, I hated the glare of the screen outdoors with the Kindle Fire, the feel of the screen, the battery life, distracting apps, etc. 

A friend recommended a Paperwhite the other day, and it blew my mind. I’d been so out of the ebook game, I’d never even heard of it. The idea of a device so closely resembling paper, being glare-free, waterproof, Bluetooth-compatible, compact size, which is easy for travel, and just overall feeling like my dream reading package, has truly inspired me to read again. I tore through the same book I owned in paperback and had been struggling to read in only two days on the Kindle, even with a busy schedule, something I can’t remember the last time I did. I was able to read in the dark, outside, anytime. And I’ve loved every second of it. 

*Long Story Short*

If you haven’t heard of the Kindle Paperwhite and have any doubts about if you would ever like e-books, the PaperWhite may change your mind.

EDIT:

Someone pointed out it’s the E-Ink and backlight that makes me enjoy it so much, which other types of Kindles have. So I guess I’ve learned that that *type * of technology is what has me so excited with never being introduced to it.

So far it is very interesting to compare this Modernist classic the GR, a Postmodernist classic.

When I first read the book I really liked Dedalus but so far on this reread I prefer Bloom because he provides a more solid foundation while Dedalus is drifting through the ether.

Kitchen Confidential – Anthony Bourdain

Synopsis (blurb from the back cover):

""I've been a chef in New York for more than ten years, and, for the decade before that, a dishwasher, a prep drone, a line cook, and a sous-chef. I came into the business when cooks still smoked on the line and wore headbands."" After twenty-five years of 'sex, drugs, bad behaviour and haute cuisine', chef and novelist Anthony Bourdain has decided to tell all. From his first oyster in the Gironde to his lowly position as a dishwasher in a honky tonk fish restaurant in Provincetown (where he first experiences the real delights of being a chef); from the kitchen of the Rainbow Room atop the Rockefeller Center to drug dealers in the East Village, from Tokyo to Paris and back to New York again, Bourdain's tales of the kitchen are as passionate as they are unpredictable, as shocking as they are funny. This unforgettable book will change the way you view restaurants for ever.

Most readers will not need this introduction to Kitchen Confidential – it has sold millions of copies and has been read by a lot of you.  For some reason I’d never read it before now though, but being gifted the book has rectified this error.
**I absolutely loved this book!**  I was a fan of Anthony Bourdain although I’d never read any of his writing and a lot of his TV series passed me by too.  I’ve always appreciated his humanity and curiosity, and I’m glad to report that his personality shines from these pages.  I thought that it shares its style with the likes of Hunter S. Thompson and Ernest Hemingway but although many of the stories are from an aggressive and unreconstructed male environment, you can tell Bourdain is fully aware of this, and contextualises it well.  Kitchen Confidential must have created a hell of a stir when it came out, blowing the lid on the shady practices and chaotic shadows of the commercial culinary world in the late 20th century.

&lt;p&gt;Kitchen Confidential – Anthony Bourdain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synopsis (blurb from the back cover):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve been a chef in New York for more than ten years, and, for the decade before that, a dishwasher, a prep drone, a line cook, and a sous-chef. I came into the business when cooks still smoked on the line and wore headbands.&amp;quot; After twenty-five years of &amp;#39;sex, drugs, bad behaviour and haute cuisine&amp;#39;, chef and novelist Anthony Bourdain has decided to tell all. From his first oyster in the Gironde to his lowly position as a dishwasher in a honky tonk fish restaurant in Provincetown (where he first experiences the real delights of being a chef); from the kitchen of the Rainbow Room atop the Rockefeller Center to drug dealers in the East Village, from Tokyo to Paris and back to New York again, Bourdain&amp;#39;s tales of the kitchen are as passionate as they are unpredictable, as shocking as they are funny. This unforgettable book will change the way you view restaurants for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most readers will not need this introduction to Kitchen Confidential – it has sold millions of copies and has been read by a lot of you.  For some reason I’d never read it before now though, but being gifted the book has rectified this error.
&lt;strong&gt;I absolutely loved this book!&lt;/strong&gt;  I was a fan of Anthony Bourdain although I’d never read any of his writing and a lot of his TV series passed me by too.  I’ve always appreciated his humanity and curiosity, and I’m glad to report that his personality shines from these pages.  I thought that it shares its style with the likes of Hunter S. Thompson and Ernest Hemingway but although many of the stories are from an aggressive and unreconstructed male environment, you can tell Bourdain is fully aware of this, and contextualises it well.  Kitchen Confidential must have created a hell of a stir when it came out, blowing the lid on the shady practices and chaotic shadows of the commercial culinary world in the late 20th century.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to mention Chapter 4 especially – titled “A Day In The Life”.  This chapter is restricted to one typical day working in a kitchen, and is actually one of the longest chapters in the book.  I have never read such an intense, non-stop assault on the senses in my life, and it is worth reading the book for this chapter alone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was left wanting to travel more, to experience life more fully, and to eat.  Eat stuff I would never normally eat, in the company of characters I wouldn’t usually speak to, and to trust in the generosity of others.  The loss of Anthony Bourdain has left the world a less colourful place.  I&amp;#39;ve already started &amp;quot;A Cooks Tour&amp;quot; to keep the Bourdain experience going..&lt;/p&gt;

https://www.taschen.com/pages/en/company/blog/220.revealing_shots.htm

It's a massive box, with the bound book inside. Limited to 1712 copies. The box and the book was larger than the small tables of the cafe.

I didn't make any photos, sorry.

But it's sitting there, waiting for guests to browse while munching on their Croque Madame or the Schnitzel.

We joked about trying to buy it from them for 20 or 25 bucks, but I'm not ruthless enough for that.

So when we paid, we asked the waitress if she knew that they basically had a 1000 CHF book sitting around and they couldn't believe it.

I think I had read a review of this book when it came out, so it kind of rang a bell when I saw it (though I couldn't place it) - and I know that ""Taschen"" specializes in expensive, one-offs with very low number of copies.

But when I looked it up, the price still took me by surprise a bit. I had expected it to be quite expensive, but not a four-digit sum.

Then the staff all moved towards the book-rack and looked at every other book to see if they had another rare edition - it was comical ;-)

I absolutely loved it and borrowed, one at a time, the other ones completely out of order, but I didn't much care about that. So finally the day came when I borrowed Reaper Man. As many other Pratchett-readers I had come to really like the Discworlds Death. And when I like spellbound am reading this book I get towards the end of the book, where Death says one of his best lines to Azrael, just at the end of the right hand page: ""WHAT CAN THE HARVEST HOPE FOR, IF NOT FOR THE CARE OF THE REAPER MAN?""

Ensorceled and with my young heart in my throat I turn the page. And there emblazoned on one whole page is Azraels answer. I still remember the flurry of emotions this moment in this book gave me.

Now we skip a rough decade into the future. I then start to think about reading the Discworld novels chronologically in it's original English. Said and done, I buy the first couple of books in paperback. Not surprisingly I also love them, perhaps even more now that some of the more untranslateable jokes makes sense to me. Some of them I like better others, but I just can't wait to get to Reaper Man again, and finally the day arrives.

So I dig into my newly bought paperback copy of Reaper Man with excitement. I read and read, and finally I come to that remembered place in the novel, just a couple of pages now. I turn a page and my heart sank. There, jumbled in the middle of text, is Azraels answer, badly typeset, with no tension at all.

I finished the book with a lot less enthusiasm than I entered with. I continued to read some more Discworld novels after that, but I lost the momentum. I also discovered that Feet of Clay had some typographical problems in the paperback version that I bought. After reading Hogfather, I went on to other stuff. 

I read later on the internet that this typesetting error had disturbed Pratchett who actually wanted the book in the way that I read it in my native language. 

Maybe it's silly of me, but I just lost momentum and enthusiasm and have not been able to get back to Discworld. I probably will eventually. Silly or not I just wanted to share it, and I wonder if anyone else have had their reading experience spoiled by similar things?

&lt;p&gt;I finished the book with a lot less enthusiasm than I entered with. I continued to read some more Discworld novels after that, but I lost the momentum. I also discovered that Feet of Clay had some typographical problems in the paperback version that I bought. After reading Hogfather, I went on to other stuff. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read later on the internet that this typesetting error had disturbed Pratchett who actually wanted the book in the way that I read it in my native language. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#39;s silly of me, but I just lost momentum and enthusiasm and have not been able to get back to Discworld. I probably will eventually. Silly or not I just wanted to share it, and I wonder if anyone else have had their reading experience spoiled by similar things?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR The bad typography of the English paperback version of Reaper Man made me stop reading the Discworld novels, but I probably will start again sometime in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

It wasn't just the Maya books that were burned. The Aztecs, &gt;Mixtecs, and a few others also had paper documents that &gt;recorded things ranging from history and religious rituals to tax records. From the eight surviving Mixtec codices, we can reconstruct the history of this one valley in Oaxaca going back 800 years. I think we can safely assume that had the other books survived, we would have something approaching a complete history of Mesoamerica at least going back to the Early Postclassic, and in some regions probably earlier.

Put simply, the Spanish book burning is why we talk about Mesoamerica in archaeology classes and not history classes.

So many things happened there, a very stupid game of ""Let's all tell the most shamefull thing each one of the people did.

I am passing by to reccomend the Temptation of St. Antony. It's a wonderfully written book with prose that's extremely evocative in it's wording.

In summary it tells the story of Antony, a monk that's depriving himself of all worldly pleasures in an attempt to reach sainthood, while being haunted by terrible visions of lust, greed and violence, many being born out of his own ego and desires. The descriptions of such visions are written in a ghastly, haunting manner, akin to one's most feverish dreams. One of such presents itself when he meets the tempting vision of the Queen Of Sheba;

""I am not a woman: I am a world! My cloak has only to fall in order that thou mayest discover a succession of mysteries. Do you want the shield of Dgian-ben-Dgian, who built the pyramids? There it is! Upon one side are represented all the wars that have taken place since the invention of weapons; and upon the other, all the wars that will take place until the end of the world.""

Or when his disciple, Hilarion, presents the incongruencies in his interpretations of what pleases God;

""Hypocrite! burying thyself in solitude only in order the more fully to abandon thyself to the indulgence of thy envious desires! What if thou dost deprive thyself of meats, of wine, of warmth, of bath, of slaves, or honours?—dost thou not permit thy imagination to offer thee banquets, perfumes, women, and the applause of multitudes? Thy chastity is but a more subtle form of corruption, and thy contempt of this world is but the impotence of thy hatred against it! Either this it is that makes such as thyself so lugubrious, or else 'tis doubt. The possession of truth giveth joy. Was Jesus sad? Did he not travel in the company of friends, repose beneath the shade of olive trees, enter the house of the publican, drink many cups of wine, pardon the sinning woman, and assuage all sorrows? Thou!—thou hast no pity save for thine own misery! It is like a remorse that gnaws thee, a savage madness that impels thee to repel the caress of a dog or to frown upon the smile of a child.""

The book is filled front-to-back with gems of prose such as the ones I present here. I highly reccomend it to anyone interested in the themes of faith, alienation and nihilism, but it presents itself  as much more than that, also being sort of an account of the many heresies born out Christianity and it's interpretations, along with the philosophical problems of such.

Except, the two last books I tried reading in this genre were total shit: Ken Follett's ""The Pillars of the Earth"" and ""Paris"" by Edward Rutherfurd. I couldn't even read halfway through these books, they were so badly written:

1. The characters explain historical stuff in dialogue, which makes everything seem very artificial. No-one speaks like that! It becomes so clear that the sole purpose of the dialogue is to explain overarching historical concepts to the reader.
2. The characters are under-developed and stupid and irrational. They're cardboard figures. Tom Builder in ""Pillars"" is the most annoyingly stupid piece of shit. Ellen has a ""hot body"", in his opinion. As if anyone spoke like that in the middle ages. Also, according to Tom, Ellen is stuck with ""her weird son"", which is such a stupid description! Also, Tom falls madly in love with Ellen at first sight, and completely forgets that his wife aka ""soulmate"" just died. Wtf? Am I supposed to believe this? Follett basically just states ""She was his soul mate"" when describing their relationship. Ooooh right. I'll just accept that, despite being offered no description what so ever of what their relationship is actually like. All Follett does is just tell, tell, tell, without actually showing anything. And then there's Rutherfurd's ""Paris"", of which I read exactly one chapter before calling it quits. What made me put the book away? The scene where Jacques Le Sourd just suddenly, out of nowhere, tells his mother he wants to kill the son of the man who killed his father. His mother is like ""kool, but be careful and patient"". Ooookay? Just like that, out of the blue? What thoughts went through this Jacques-guy's head when his mother told him about his father's killer? We will never know. All I know is that the author apparently thought KILLING some innocent kid would be a perfectly rational response. DISCLAIMER: I didn't read further because it seemed too stupid. Correct me if I've got this all wrong, if this scene is given a further explanation later in the book. It just doesn't seem like that kind of book to me.

I think historical ficiton is an incredibly complex genre and really difficult to pull off. First of all, you need to convey the historical facts, but also create a story that is plausible and believable. Then you have to weave the two into each other without compromising one or the other. This means you have to explain the historical facts while also making the dialogues natural. This is where a lot of writers struggle. Also, the characters are very easily made into cardboard figures because they're just there to move the plot forwards, and very often they tend to fall into a stereotype without personality: an aristocrat, a nazi, a priest, a princess, etc etc.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I absolutely love history and historical fiction.

I guess I just don't get it?

I don't understand how people so easily overlook the gigantic flaws of this book, or praise the main character so much. For the first 3/4ths of the book I couldn't stand him. He takes advantage of his semi-conscious wife to have sex with her when she's too tired to deny him? How does nobody give a shit about this part? And the way Williams writes about her as if she's some evil witch creates such a lopsided narrative. She obviously had some major problem or trauma with her father, as evident by destroying everything related to him after he passed, and then she basically has to settle for an arranged marriage with someone who couldn't get the hint that she can barely stand him. Williams decides though that she's waging some war against Stoner just because? If you take it as being written from Stoner's perspective it's not any better. It means he's completely oblivious to anybody's experience but his, which doesn't make for a very sympathetic character either.

Williams' writing of women is pretty bad in general. In the affair with Katherine she tells Stoner that when she's with him she feels like ""the slut of the world."" ........ okay? Who the fuck says that? Nobody. Their whole portion reads kind of like some braincel fantasy. He says something along the lines of ""neither of them knew that the pursuit of knowledge and of lust could coincide, let alone heighten each other."" Also, Katherine happens to only have been with one other man, pretty much so it could be explained that Stoner is filling every void that her previous man couldn't.

As far as the whole ""stoic hero"", for the first 200 some pages he is two things, and neither of them are ""stoic."" He's primarily a coward, who doesn't stand up for or against anything except when he's force to make some sort of decision, in which he usually votes to maintain the status quo. Secondly, he's just depressed. There's a difference between someone going stoically through life and playing it cool versus someone who just sits there letting life happen to them. Then in a short part he actually takes any sort of action about anything and makes a power move against Lomax. Cool that's fine, but then he gets cancer. Again he seems a lot less stoic than just depressed, and now drugged as well. 

Pretty much this book is the lame account of a farmboy who has no interpersonal skills, marries the first girl that's been traumatized by her father enough to passively become his wife, doesn't take any action in trying to reach a compromise in the raising of his daughter, cheats on his wife and for some reason doesn't just leave her. Again he lacks communication skills to create some sort of balance in the household. Essentially he just floats through life and takes all kinds of bullshit. That's not stoic, that's cowardly. 

There are some well written parts of the book where I can see people getting caught up. The problem is that this is not a fantastic book with a few flaws, this is a terrible book with a few redeeming qualities.

For everything else that I didn't feel like explaining here, look to the 1 and 2 star reviews on Goodreads. One of the reviews kind of summed it up too, saying something like ""The message of Stoner seems to be that most people live a banal life full of mistakes and misery with some sparse highlights.

The mothers of the main characters (and some of the minor ones) in Jane Austen's novels are all 1. Dead 2. Absent 3. Ineffectual/Fools.  Behold:


*Pride and Prejudice* - Mrs. Bennet - Very much the Fool

*Mansfield Park* - Absent mother, Fanny lives with her Uncle &amp; Aunt, even when staying with her family for a few scenes, we see very little of the mother.  The Aunt is the closest we get, and she is patently ineffective.

*Emma* - Deceased mother

*Persuasion* - Deceased mother

*Northanger Abbey* - Absent mother (?) The only Austen I haven't read, so I'm not 100% sure on this

*Sense and Sensibility* - Mrs. Dashwood - Possibly the least likely to fit this mold, but still an ineffective mother.  She has almost no impact on her daughters lives.  Elinor acts more as the mother to her and her sisters, while Marianne merely does whatever she wants.  No real advice or guidance is forthcoming from Mrs. Dashwood.

Obviously, the worldbuilding is top-notch, it was one of the things that drew me to the books after I heard so many rave about it. The world felt extremely thorough and believable. The magic was great - allomancy, feruchemy, hemalurgy - wonderful ideas executed in a clear way.
The plot was so strong, it's obvious the whole way through that we only understand a fraction of what's happening in the world and why. The mystery of it all was probably the most compelling reason to read it. It's also obvious that B.S. knows exactly where he's going with his story, and I trusted him the whole way through to deliver in the final book, which he did.

That being said, I resented a little how the book talked down to its reader. This seemed to mainly come in the form of excessive repetition of what we already knew; how magic works, the needs and troubles of the characters, the plot points. It felt as though we wouldn't be trusted to remember such complex ideas, and while I understand the need for a refresher throughout a trilogy, I think it could have been done a little more subtly.

I think, if I'm being honest, that the dialogue in these books was maybe the weakest part, it seemed like B.S. was often trying to write what I would call 'banter' among the crew, and I never felt it landed, not in the way that say, Scott Lynch absolutely *nails* in The  Lies Of Locke Lamora. Dialogue is hard to do for a lot of writers because you're walking this line between being believable but not necessarily realistic, and I don't think Mistborn got it right. Vin and Elend's relationship definitely had some nice moments, but overall I felt I was repeatedly told rather than shown what was going on between them. It lacked... emotional depth and perhaps a touch of nuance?  

I felt the character motivations were very well established, too well. So many times I'd end up skimming paragraphs because Vin is worried about who she is, *again*, or Sazed is waxing lyrical on religion, or Elend is questioning his leadership skills. Having character motivations and needs be clear is vital in storytelling of course, but I felt it was overdone here. It got a bit repetitive, even giving the game away in places (for instance I had no doubt that Vin would undoubtedly find her place in the world as a vital part of the story because of her repeated musings on her place in the world.) and I resented a little being told explicitly over and over how the characters were feeling and thinking. I prefer a book that gives me the clues and lets me work it out, dipping into the POVC's brain only occasionally, there were SO many paragraphs that was just what the characters were thinking.

I personally found Elend's transformation from bumbling noble into strong King with the help of the Terris woman perhaps the most satisfying change in the book, and I would have enjoyed Vin's transformation more if she didn't keep explicitly stating how much she had changed in her head.

The second book suffers from middle book syndrome, as others have said. It was a bit slow and the weakest of the trilogy. Once things slowed down a bit I realised I wasn't particularly invested in the characters, and never really felt worried about them dying or not achieving their goals. A lot of the secondary characters felt a little two-dimensional, Kelsier's friend's (I can't recall his name now) death during the siege of Luthadel just came out of nowhere, it felt arbitrary and lacked emotional impact, which was a shame.

The third book was good, tied up everything well, but dragged a little in parts, and felt rushed in others. Personally, I enjoyed the first book the most.

I don't want to shit on the books, I found them inspiring and I'm extremely glad I read them. I'll go on to the Stormlight Archive after I finish rereading The Lies Of Locke Lamora. B.S. is obviously a very talented writer and there's a ton that he got right, I'm wondering how his other books fare in comparison?

I never saw the 1990 version, never read it, never saw the recent film, but just like everyone knows, i knew it was a horror story about a killer clown. In fact, I would bet a lot of people with clown fears still picture that terrifying Tim Curry depiction from 1990, I know I never saw the film but I saw pictures and it downright terrified me.

I finally decided to read “It”, and wow I was blown away. Not perfect by any means, King tends to write a little more than necessary at certain times(one of his charms I suppose) . But it was so much more than some nihilistic horror. This was an epic adventure tale, commenting perfectly on the feeling of growing up, friendship, love, nostalgia, all of that. Like many King novels, it was a book about the struggle between cosmic forces of good and evil. 

I think what I loved most about the story, is that even in spite of the super natural element, it is *so* relatable and taps into that nostalgic point of childhood so much.  I’m only in my 20s, I didn’t play as a kid in the 50s. But I still remembers my 5th grade days riding bikes around the neighborhood, building forts in the creek, meet up at the woods behind our school every day since it was the center of all my friends. I look back on those days now which really seem like such distant memories. Those friendships. That feeling of: you can never be a kid again, but you can still cherish those childhood moments (if you were fortunate to have a good one). 

Really, the book caught me completely off guard. I would love to discuss it.

Side note: Does King have a Richie Tolzier character in every novel?

So here I am, on the fifth anniversary of his passing, going round once more.\n\nOver the next few (or several, or dozen, or who knows how many) months I’ll be publishing thoughts and ramblings on Iain Banks, the Culture novels and their related works. I tend to take a mostly spoiler-free approach when writing about fiction, opting instead to focus more on theme, style, prose, narrative structure, and characterization while keeping recaps to a minimum. There is no shortage of excellent recap and synopsis writing available elsewhere, but I’m much more interested in introducing these books to readers in a way that doesn’t ruin the potential enjoyment of discovery. That being said, in order to discuss certain aspects of Culture novels, I may have to bend my usual rules slightly, but I promise I’ll do everything I can to keep spoilers to a minimum and mark them where applicable.\n\nSo, let’s begin with Banks himself:\n\n \n\n**Caledonian Antisyzygy and the Principle of Charity**\n\nBanks was a highly prolific writer, publishing a total of thirty books over twenty-nine years. He considered himself a science fiction writer, but his creative output was wide, covering also the spectrum of mainstream literary fiction, memoir/travelogue, and a posthumous collection of poetry — his own bundled together with those of his lifelong friend and fellow Scottish science fiction writer Ken MacLeod. As a fierce, outspoken leftist, socialist, and atheist with a quick sardonic wit, Banks was often in the news regarding UK and world politics, particularly regarding Britain’s participation in the West’s post 9/11 involvement in Iraq.\n\nIn his home country of Scotland and the rest of the UK he may be best known for his highly polarizing 1984 debut, The Wasp Factory. A book which famously printed alternating positive and negative blurbs from various publications on its dust jacket and subsequent paperback editions. A brilliant piece of marketing if you ask me. Or possibly it’s his 1992 novel The Crow Road that he’s best known for. It’s an enrapturing and mysterious portrait of a large intertwined familial Scottish community that began with the unforgettable first line: “It was the day my grandmother exploded.”\n\nAlthough his novels have been critically lauded worldwide, none of his mainstream literary fiction, what he referred to as his “hampstead novels”, achieved much measurable popularity in the United States. Here, he’s best known for his Culture series of science fiction novels, and even that work is relatively unknown. Something that is hopefully about to change with the upcoming Amazon Studios adaptation of Consider Phlebas.\n\nAs an American, I regret that Iain Banks wasn’t properly on my radar until he died of gallbladder cancer in 2013, just two months after announcing to the world that he was “officially very poorly”. Since stumbling upon his work I have devoured all but one of his science fiction novels (published under the quite obvious pseudonym of Iain M. Banks) and a handful of his mainstream novels (published without the M).\n\nThere is a certain thread of macabre humor and fascination with the dark corners of human nature that binds most of his work together. He also had a unique internal dialogue of opposing ideas encapsulated in his novels. While doing some research in preparation for this essay, I stumbled upon the concept of antisyzygy, and more specifically what is referred to as Caledonian antisyzygy, or in other words, the Scottish variety.\n\nThe term was first used in 1919 by George Gregory Smith, a Scottish literary critic, in his book Scottish Literature: Character and Influence. He described it as “..a reflection of the contrasts which the Scot shows at every turn, in his political and ecclesiastical history, in his polemical restlessness, in his adaptability, which is another way of saying that he has made allowance for new conditions, in his practical judgement, which is the admission that two sides of the matter have been considered.”\n\nI found this fascinating, mainly because I have never come across a more perfect description of how Banks explores philosophies and ideas in his writing. In her book The Mighty Scot, Maureen M. Martin further elaborates: “Writings by Scots on their country’s national psyche and literature often point to what has been called a ‘Caledonian antisyzygy’ —a conflict between rational and romantic, canny and reckless, moralistic and violent, an idea of dueling polarities within one entity that finds fictional expression..” The revelation that this duality is common not only among Scottish writers, but the Scottish people in general lends credence to the idea that something about the historical, political, religious and social aspects of Scottish life creates this internalized way of dealing with conflict.\n\nI find that Caledonian antisyzygy is deeply entwined in everything Iain Banks wrote. In all of his fiction he spends quite a lot of time chipping away at his own arguments as if they were opposing views, patching and refining them over the course of each book. He does this frequently, and most effectively in his Culture novels, and he’s very, very good at it. As a reader you find yourself unsure of your own opinions by the end of a Banks novel. Instead of an end all solution to whatever question has been posited by the story, you’re left in the wake of the dissonance created by the question itself, with a variety of possible solutions to consider. In 1990, in conversation with the British science fiction writer Michael Cobley he discussed his approach toward writing: “..in fiction the trick is to give people a choice of potential answers so they can disagree with what you’re saying, or what they think you’re saying.”\n\nOffering that option to the reader, to be free to disagree with the message, and still enjoy the book on some level, creates a well rounded experience and speaks to his mastery of the craft. It also gives each story the possibility to resonate on different levels for different readers, not to mention enabling tremendous reread value, and lending towards several different possible interpretations by the same reader when read at different points in their life.\n\nAnother aspect of his writing that’s worth noting, is just how fully he explores the societies or ideas in opposition to his main social ideals as represented by the Culture. He isn’t merely setting up straw men to be easily overcome. This approach reminds me of the Principle of Charity, which states that when in argument with an opponent, argue against the most charitable version of their view. Mainly, assume they’ve come to their argument rationally, and have valid reasons for believing as they do. Only then can you have a meaningful dialogue with someone holding an opposing view to your own.\n\nI’ll be back in the coming weeks to discuss Consider Phlebas, his first published Culture novel, and in my opinion, one of his least understood and most divisive. If you haven’t yet read any Iain Banks, it’s a fantastic time to start. This weekend pick up a Banks novel, preferably a Culture book and spend a little time celebrating his life by getting to know one of the most unique writers of our modern time. The series of books share almost no continuity with one another, so feel free to dig in anywhere. I highly recommend The Player of Games as an easy entry point as well as one of the best in the series.', 'author_fullname': 't2_1loduyyy', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': ""Iain Banks passed away 6 years ago today.

That being said, in order to discuss certain aspects of Culture novels, I may have to bend my usual rules slightly, but I promise I’ll do everything I can to keep spoilers to a minimum and mark them where applicable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, let’s begin with Banks himself:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caledonian Antisyzygy and the Principle of Charity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Banks was a highly prolific writer, publishing a total of thirty books over twenty-nine years. He considered himself a science fiction writer, but his creative output was wide, covering also the spectrum of mainstream literary fiction, memoir/travelogue, and a posthumous collection of poetry — his own bundled together with those of his lifelong friend and fellow Scottish science fiction writer Ken MacLeod. As a fierce, outspoken leftist, socialist, and atheist with a quick sardonic wit, Banks was often in the news regarding UK and world politics, particularly regarding Britain’s participation in the West’s post 9/11 involvement in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In his home country of Scotland and the rest of the UK he may be best known for his highly polarizing 1984 debut, The Wasp Factory. A book which famously printed alternating positive and negative blurbs from various publications on its dust jacket and subsequent paperback editions. A brilliant piece of marketing if you ask me. Or possibly it’s his 1992 novel The Crow Road that he’s best known for. It’s an enrapturing and mysterious portrait of a large intertwined familial Scottish community that began with the unforgettable first line: “It was the day my grandmother exploded.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although his novels have been critically lauded worldwide, none of his mainstream literary fiction, what he referred to as his “hampstead novels”, achieved much measurable popularity in the United States. Here, he’s best known for his Culture series of science fiction novels, and even that work is relatively unknown. Something that is hopefully about to change with the upcoming Amazon Studios adaptation of Consider Phlebas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an American, I regret that Iain Banks wasn’t properly on my radar until he died of gallbladder cancer in 2013, just two months after announcing to the world that he was “officially very poorly”. Since stumbling upon his work I have devoured all but one of his science fiction novels (published under the quite obvious pseudonym of Iain M. Banks) and a handful of his mainstream novels (published without the M).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a certain thread of macabre humor and fascination with the dark corners of human nature that binds most of his work together. He also had a unique internal dialogue of opposing ideas encapsulated in his novels. While doing some research in preparation for this essay, I stumbled upon the concept of antisyzygy, and more specifically what is referred to as Caledonian antisyzygy, or in other words, the Scottish variety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The term was first used in 1919 by George Gregory Smith, a Scottish literary critic, in his book Scottish Literature: Character and Influence. He described it as “..a reflection of the contrasts which the Scot shows at every turn, in his political and ecclesiastical history, in his polemical restlessness, in his adaptability, which is another way of saying that he has made allowance for new conditions, in his practical judgement, which is the admission that two sides of the matter have been considered.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found this fascinating, mainly because I have never come across a more perfect description of how Banks explores philosophies and ideas in his writing. In her book The Mighty Scot, Maureen M. Martin further elaborates: “Writings by Scots on their country’s national psyche and literature often point to what has been called a ‘Caledonian antisyzygy’ —a conflict between rational and romantic, canny and reckless, moralistic and violent, an idea of dueling polarities within one entity that finds fictional expression..” The revelation that this duality is common not only among Scottish writers, but the Scottish people in general lends credence to the idea that something about the historical, political, religious and social aspects of Scottish life creates this internalized way of dealing with conflict.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find that Caledonian antisyzygy is deeply entwined in everything Iain Banks wrote. In all of his fiction he spends quite a lot of time chipping away at his own arguments as if they were opposing views, patching and refining them over the course of each book. He does this frequently, and most effectively in his Culture novels, and he’s very, very good at it. As a reader you find yourself unsure of your own opinions by the end of a Banks novel. Instead of an end all solution to whatever question has been posited by the story, you’re left in the wake of the dissonance created by the question itself, with a variety of possible solutions to consider. In 1990, in conversation with the British science fiction writer Michael Cobley he discussed his approach toward writing: “..in fiction the trick is to give people a choice of potential answers so they can disagree with what you’re saying, or what they think you’re saying.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Offering that option to the reader, to be free to disagree with the message, and still enjoy the book on some level, creates a well rounded experience and speaks to his mastery of the craft. It also gives each story the possibility to resonate on different levels for different readers, not to mention enabling tremendous reread value, and lending towards several different possible interpretations by the same reader when read at different points in their life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of his writing that’s worth noting, is just how fully he explores the societies or ideas in opposition to his main social ideals as represented by the Culture. He isn’t merely setting up straw men to be easily overcome. This approach reminds me of the Principle of Charity, which states that when in argument with an opponent, argue against the most charitable version of their view. Mainly, assume they’ve come to their argument rationally, and have valid reasons for believing as they do. Only then can you have a meaningful dialogue with someone holding an opposing view to your own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ll be back in the coming weeks to discuss Consider Phlebas, his first published Culture novel, and in my opinion, one of his least understood and most divisive. If you haven’t yet read any Iain Banks, it’s a fantastic time to start. This weekend pick up a Banks novel, preferably a Culture book and spend a little time celebrating his life by getting to know one of the most unique writers of our modern time. The series of books share almost no continuity with one another, so feel free to dig in anywhere. I highly recommend The Player of Games as an easy entry point as well as one of the best in the series.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None,

Jim poured himself a glass of whisky, sighed about his ex girlfriend, and said ""remember when we were younger, and we dreamed of being rockstars? I always dreamed of having as much Hennessy as I want while having lots of sex with lots of groupies"". 

Ignoring the fact that Jim is utterly terrible at guitar, his dream isn't exactly an uncommon one. Millions of kids around the world idolize rockstars, and the live fast, die young lifestyle surely has it's draws. 

Now every day when you turn on the news, what do you see? You see political upheaval, violence, suffering, unemployment. In the World State? There is none of that, society is peaceful, humming along nicely. Hell, as a terribly student, they even fixed the education problem, by teaching people in their sleep!

Let's look at the positives of World State? World peace, political stability, no torturous years in school, lots of sex, lots of drugs, live fast, die young. Sounds like a pretty damned good Utopia to me!

So what is allegedly wrong with World State? People have no agency, You are born into a caste at birth, and there is no way out of it. People are spiritually empty, that materialism cannot solve all of their problems. 

At the end of the day, Brave New World is a republican nightmare, but a monarchist dream. Consider the great divide between monarchist and republican thinking:

In traditional monarchist ideology, there is a natural order of things. Kings rule with divine right and people know their lot in life. As Confucius argued, the ideal state is stratified but organized, where everyone knows their place, and the ruler rules well. 

This is in contrast with the republican ideal of agency, where one should have a right to decide their place in life. Remember, the rallying cry of the American revolution was ""no taxation without representation"", not ""we want lower taxes"". It was also ""give me liberty or give me death"" not ""give me prosperity or give me death"". 

A state where everyone gets their needs taken care of, where there is a rigid social order is the monarchist dream. But it is fundamentally the antithesis of the republican idea. 

But here's the thing though, republicans believe in the idea of ""the pursuit of happiness"" as a fundamental right. But in World State people literally have chemicals to give them happiness, they have been given peace. 

There is this idea in politics of the ""temporarily embarrassed millionaire"", that it is possible to have poor people support policies that benefit the rich by convincing them that they too, can be rich, and that they're just temporarily poor. But is that not the idea that Brave New World is trying to exploit? That although you are unhappy, struggling to get by, that despite the fact you work an unfulfilling job and are suffering from crippling loneliness, that you should view a state that gives everyone everything but spiritual fufillment and social advancement as a distopia. Because one day, just one day you might be able to improve your station in life? 

We live in a world where millions of people die to war and conflict. Millions more live in crippling poverty. Anti-depressant use is spiraling out of control, and suicide is one of the leading causes of death. So just how bad is World State anyways? And you'll be giving up is the miniscule possibility of spiritual fufillment and the tiny chance they you can rise above your station in life. 

Statistically speaking, the vast majority of the world does not exceed the station of their birth through luck and hard work. Statistically speaking, almost nobody achieves spiritual fufillment. So therefore, statistically speaking, Brave New World should be a Utopia. Peace on Earth and economic prosperity as a trade for the miniscule chance of social advancement? Statistically you should make that choice.

On one level I liked *Carry On* a lot. Although the characters and worldbuilding are very heavily Harry-Potter-influenced they are also distinctly different in such a way that they can be appreciated on their own merits and don't need to be directly compared as better or worse.

On another level, though, I feel kind of more ambivalent about it, and that's directly related to how it originates out of fandom culture and the Harry Potter fandom in particular.

And despite the differences between Harry Potter and *Carry On*, they are still similar enough that *Carry On* could easily be read as a commentary on Harry Potter or even a how-it-should-have-been fixit kind of thing – hell, at one point [](#s ""the Mage"") even rants ""[](#s ""What is the greater good?"")"", which is way too on the nose for my taste – and if that *was* the intention behind it, then I disagree with it completely.

I think people expect the difference to be one of the following:

1. Elitism: The idea that some texts are worthy, and some texts are not. So, the difference between studying at the university level versus at the fan level is one of content (e.g. “There is a difference between studying the classics and some silly T.V. show”).
2. Author Knowledge: The idea that my studies consist of looking into the fine details of an author’s life in order to understand the inspirations that led to a particular work of genius. (e.g. “Jane Austin had purple curtains in her childhood bedroom, and this was her inspiration for the way purple is used in this scene”).

Both of these assumptions are incorrect, but understandable.

Elitism has been a part of University entrance and attendance from the beginning. We have since decided that University entrance should be based on ability instead of class. It should be that way, but as the recent controversy over entrance bribes shows, that is not sadly not the reality. Some people assume that because I am part of the University, my professional attitudes must be elitist as well.

People assume I sieve the good work from the bad based on examples of great literature like Hamlet. I would never argue that Hamlet is not great literature, but I would argue that it is a tiny biased template of what literature can be and do. Yes, I have studied Hamlet. I have also studied Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand by the brilliant Samuel Delany. If you are sieving for more things exactly like Hamlet, you will miss this novel and so many others.

You might find yourself wondering, as I did during my studies: how do you know if something is good literature if it isn’t a classic? After all, isn’t what you enjoy in books a matter of personal taste? If it is just a matter of taste, someone who really likes Game of Thrones and does a lot of online analysis about it in their spare time appears to be doing the same thing I do.

The simple truth is, those hobbyists *are* engaged in the same activity that I do for a living, just at a smaller scale and with less knowledge than I have about studying literature (not about Game of Thrones – I assume there are many people who know more about the show/books than I do).

This leads us to the second idea, Author Knowledge, which has logic that works like this: if hobbyists are doing what I do, but have less knowledge, that knowledge must be about “what the story really means” which is knowledge that comes from the author (who obviously knows their own story best). Therefore, knowing the most about the author must mean that you also know the most about what the story “really means.”

Insanely long edit:

&amp;#x200B;

This post very unexpectedly blew up. If I had realized it was going to reach so many people I would have been more careful in the framing of this post, and included the fact that I fall into the ""death of the author"" camp (read Barthes if you're interested), which is a common but by no means universally agreed upon in my field.

&amp;#x200B;

To the people who are asking for recommendations at improving their skills at literary/textual analysis:

 

The first step is to find your interests.

Classics really interest some people because they enjoy the research involved with understanding particular things properly. Other people would rather cut off a finger with pruning sheers than read the unabridged Moby Dick and be held accountable for knowing and understanding every single detail of it.

If you're in the pruning category, avoid any classics that would require research you wouldn't enjoy, such as the entire process of rendering lamp oil, from the techniques of whale hunting, to the slaughter and processing and storage of the blubber as it becomes oil, and the particular specifications of the ship which is required to both hunt effectively and render efficiently.

Read things in the genre you like that are more difficult than what you're reading now. There are a ton of book clubs and sites like goodreads that can help give you specific recommendations. As you read, ""engage critically"" (i.e. ask questions), think about what the story is about and how it works and how you are supposed to feel about certain parts of the book. If the book is pushing you to feel a certain way about a character's decision, ask why. Theorize. Then find people to run your theory by. Then read, theorize, bounce your ideas off knowledgeable people again, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

To the people who are asking ""so what IS the difference between what you do and GoT fans do?""

&amp;#x200B;

I'd say about 80% of it is exactly the same.

&amp;#x200B;

I shouldn't have used GoT as an example because I'm not that familiar with it. Let's use The Catcher in the Rye.

People hate this novel. There is a popular opinion which has been attributed to literary theorists that this novel is not worth reading because it's just a bunch of whiny wealthy white guy problems passing off as art.

People (humanities academics included) have taken issue with how the novel is being taught in US high schools because it so often gets taught as a lesson on universal feelings as a person comes of age. It is a coming of age story, but it's not universally applicable. Holden has the reactions he does because of who he is. The whole book is about who he is and how and why he can't trust people ""phonies"" which includes the fact that he is wealthy, white, male, and educated. It's a different coming of age experience than you find in The House on Mango Street or The Absolutely True Diary of a Part Time Indian. They're all great coming of age novels, but the differences matter, and none of it is entirely universal.

People sometimes hear this and respond ""so white male experience doesn't matter?"" (of course it matters, it just doesn't inherently matter more than any other experience). 

People sometimes hear this and respond ""all critics do is complain and ruin perfectly good things!"" (if you believe that entertainment and media companies/publishers are neutral purveyors of neutral content that shouldn't be questioned, I don't know how to convince you otherwise).

The difference in my work and the work of someone outside of academics has a lot to do with access, and some to do with training. Through my university library I have access to literally millions of peer reviewed sources from pretty much every subject that has been studied since about the 1960's. Through my universities particular archives and museum, I have access to even more primary source material that is unavailable to the public. I can look up the office hours and email of any professor on campus and ask for a 30 minute interview about whatever subject I need to know more about (the History department is great for tackling Moby Dick). I have an incredible amount of access to expert knowledge and to experts themselves. That access and training I would say accounts for most of that difference.

The price I pay for that access is... well, if you're read up on tuition spikes and the adjunct crisis you already know.

&amp;#x200B;

To the people who want to insist that the author HAS to be the final authority on the meaning of their own work:

&amp;#x200B;

Stephanie Meyer wrote the Twilight series. It was hugely popular, revived the economy of a small town in the pacific northwest, got turned into movies, merchandise everywhere, die-hard fans. That makes in an important piece of literature.

It is very popular, but when you analyze the texts (books and films), and the contexts (the audience, the fanfiction, the clubs, the reviews, and, of course, the author, etc.), there are certain conclusions you can draw based on that data. Those conclusions and all relevant knowledge go through an extensive process of peer review before they are published.

One common academic interpretation of the series is that the main female character, Bella, has very little agency and therefore is not a ""feminist hero"" as some people were claiming (just because the main character is female, that doesn't mean it's a feminist book). Not every book has to be or should be a primarily feminist text. Besides, it's not a moral argument. The argument is just that these texts don't belong in this category based on the available data.

Stephanie Meyer says the book does belong in that category, and that it is a feminist book. She even wrote a wildly unpopular rewrite of the first novel in which she gender swapped the characters to prove that Bella's gender didn't effect the text, and it would be just as natural and good a story if all the characters swapped sex/genders. It's called Life and Death: Twilight Reimagined, and it's quite an experience.

If the author controls the interpretation of their own text, then Stephanie Meyer is right, and Twilight has by this action been irrefutably proven to be a feminist text.

I disagree. One of the very important tropes of the series is that Bella is either destined or fated to be with Edward. From that point she can either go with fate or work against it. Edward is the one who works against the fate he literally sees in his psychic sister's head due to his mind reading abilities. He chooses to work against fate to try to change it but eventually accepts it and decides fate (cough God cough) knows what it's doing and then Bella is happy because she always liked and wanted the life that fate laid out for her. In my opinion, that doesn't belong in the ""feminist plot"" box (again, not a moral judgement, not saying liking it means you hate women, I obviously enjoy the series enough to know this much about it). It just doesn't belong in that particular box because it has a disqualifying feature.

If the author is in control of the interpretation of their text, it goes in the box anyway because they chose their own qualifying and disqualifying features. I believe the conversation is better and more useful and productive if at a certain point we can agree that an author only has a limited input into the conversation about their text.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m a PhD student in English Literature (literature written in the English language, not Brit Lit), and I get asked “how do you know the author meant that” so often that I am writing this explanation down and hoping that it helps people who legitimately don’t get the difference between what I do and what people obsessing about the ending of Game of Thrones do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think people expect the difference to be one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elitism: The idea that some texts are worthy, and some texts are not. So, the difference between studying at the university level versus at the fan level is one of content (e.g. “There is a difference between studying the classics and some silly T.V. show”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Author Knowledge: The idea that my studies consist of looking into the fine details of an author’s life in order to understand the inspirations that led to a particular work of genius. (e.g. “Jane Austin had purple curtains in her childhood bedroom, and this was her inspiration for the way purple is used in this scene”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these assumptions are incorrect, but understandable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elitism has been a part of University entrance and attendance from the beginning. We have since decided that University entrance should be based on ability instead of class. It should be that way, but as the recent controversy over entrance bribes shows, that is not sadly not the reality. Some people assume that because I am part of the University, my professional attitudes must be elitist as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People assume I sieve the good work from the bad based on examples of great literature like Hamlet. I would never argue that Hamlet is not great literature, but I would argue that it is a tiny biased template of what literature can be and do. Yes, I have studied Hamlet. I have also studied Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand by the brilliant Samuel Delany. If you are sieving for more things exactly like Hamlet, you will miss this novel and so many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might find yourself wondering, as I did during my studies: how do you know if something is good literature if it isn’t a classic? After all, isn’t what you enjoy in books a matter of personal taste? If it is just a matter of taste, someone who really likes Game of Thrones and does a lot of online analysis about it in their spare time appears to be doing the same thing I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simple truth is, those hobbyists &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; engaged in the same activity that I do for a living, just at a smaller scale and with less knowledge than I have about studying literature (not about Game of Thrones – I assume there are many people who know more about the show/books than I do).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads us to the second idea, Author Knowledge, which has logic that works like this: if hobbyists are doing what I do, but have less knowledge, that knowledge must be about “what the story really means” which is knowledge that comes from the author (who obviously knows their own story best). Therefore, knowing the most about the author must mean that you also know the most about what the story “really means.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insanely long edit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post very unexpectedly blew up. If I had realized it was going to reach so many people I would have been more careful in the framing of this post, and included the fact that I fall into the &amp;quot;death of the author&amp;quot; camp (read Barthes if you&amp;#39;re interested), which is a common but by no means universally agreed upon in my field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the people who are asking for recommendations at improving their skills at literary/textual analysis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to find your interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classics really interest some people because they enjoy the research involved with understanding particular things properly. Other people would rather cut off a finger with pruning sheers than read the unabridged Moby Dick and be held accountable for knowing and understanding every single detail of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re in the pruning category, avoid any classics that would require research you wouldn&amp;#39;t enjoy, such as the entire process of rendering lamp oil, from the techniques of whale hunting, to the slaughter and processing and storage of the blubber as it becomes oil, and the particular specifications of the ship which is required to both hunt effectively and render efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read things in the genre you like that are more difficult than what you&amp;#39;re reading now. There are a ton of book clubs and sites like goodreads that can help give you specific recommendations. As you read, &amp;quot;engage critically&amp;quot; (i.e. ask questions), think about what the story is about and how it works and how you are supposed to feel about certain parts of the book. If the book is pushing you to feel a certain way about a character&amp;#39;s decision, ask why. Theorize. Then find people to run your theory by. Then read, theorize, bounce your ideas off knowledgeable people again, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the people who are asking &amp;quot;so what IS the difference between what you do and GoT fans do?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d say about 80% of it is exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shouldn&amp;#39;t have used GoT as an example because I&amp;#39;m not that familiar with it. Let&amp;#39;s use The Catcher in the Rye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People hate this novel. There is a popular opinion which has been attributed to literary theorists that this novel is not worth reading because it&amp;#39;s just a bunch of whiny wealthy white guy problems passing off as art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People (humanities academics included) have taken issue with how the novel is being taught in US high schools because it so often gets taught as a lesson on universal feelings as a person comes of age. It is a coming of age story, but it&amp;#39;s not universally applicable. Holden has the reactions he does because of who he is. The whole book is about who he is and how and why he can&amp;#39;t trust people &amp;quot;phonies&amp;quot; which includes the fact that he is wealthy, white, male, and educated. It&amp;#39;s a different coming of age experience than you find in The House on Mango Street or The Absolutely True Diary of a Part Time Indian. They&amp;#39;re all great coming of age novels, but the differences matter, and none of it is entirely universal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People sometimes hear this and respond &amp;quot;so white male experience doesn&amp;#39;t matter?&amp;quot; (of course it matters, it just doesn&amp;#39;t inherently matter more than any other experience). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People sometimes hear this and respond &amp;quot;all critics do is complain and ruin perfectly good things!&amp;quot; (if you believe that entertainment and media companies/publishers are neutral purveyors of neutral content that shouldn&amp;#39;t be questioned, I don&amp;#39;t know how to convince you otherwise).&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I don't remember much from my childhood, but I do remember that I read an absolute shit ton. As a kid, I was fairly shy and quiet, and I had my own fair share of bullies. But I was able to escape all of that through a good book or two. I would start a book one day and finish it by the end of the next day, immediately searching for possible sequels or replacements. I read fast and I read furiously. 

&amp;#x200B;

As time went on, I started getting involved in other things. I tried a variety of extracurricular activities throughout elementary and middle school, ranging from basketball and track to music and computers. Once I entered high school, I found my niche, the place where I felt like I belonged. I also got much more involved, and I joined two handfuls of groups and societies with the intention of building a resume up for college applications.

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate side of this story is that I had no time to myself. I couldn't read anymore than what I was already reading for my classes. There was just no time. Something had to give, and I unfortunately chose reading for fun. Four years pass and I'm suddenly graduating. I basically got my wish: admission, scholarships, awards, etc. I had worked hard for all of these things, and I felt that I was ending on a high note. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everything came crashing down in college.

&amp;#x200B;

Without going into too much detail, I felt like I was completely drowning. I dropped out and took some time to myself, tried to get some help. I got that help, but it really didn't do much. I returned to college, as I needed to keep my scholarship, and that required me to get my grades back up. I would spend the next 3 years struggling every second of every day, just doing my damndest to get by and keep that scholarship. I lost it for my fourth year by .02 GPA.

&amp;#x200B;

Flash forward to a month or two ago. I was having a really bad night, and I found myself laying in bed at 3 AM in disarray. For whatever reason, my eyes got caught on this book in my room. I had asked for this book a couple years ago, but I basically just added it to my collection of memorabilia. I knew that the book was dark, that it was gonna take me down a very difficult path, but I was desperate for something. I picked it up and started reading through the first couple pages.

&amp;#x200B;

By the end of the next day, I had finished all 250 pages of it (the font was pretty big, so it was probably more like 200). And I felt completely cathartic. It felt like I was a kid again, like the hell that followed my childhood was some distant future I wouldn't have to face. I no longer felt like the lost kid looking for a place to belong. I felt happy once again.

&amp;#x200B;

I stopped off at Barnes and Noble the other day to look for a book I had heard about recently. It was a long-ass book, and I've already finished half of it in a week. That's more reading for fun than I've done in the past 6 years alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

All this to say that reading has changed my life. And I'm thankful that I've found reading once again.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without going into too much detail, I felt like I was completely drowning. I dropped out and took some time to myself, tried to get some help. I got that help, but it really didn&amp;#39;t do much. I returned to college, as I needed to keep my scholarship, and that required me to get my grades back up. I would spend the next 3 years struggling every second of every day, just doing my damndest to get by and keep that scholarship. I lost it for my fourth year by .02 GPA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flash forward to a month or two ago. I was having a really bad night, and I found myself laying in bed at 3 AM in disarray. For whatever reason, my eyes got caught on this book in my room. I had asked for this book a couple years ago, but I basically just added it to my collection of memorabilia. I knew that the book was dark, that it was gonna take me down a very difficult path, but I was desperate for something. I picked it up and started reading through the first couple pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the next day, I had finished all 250 pages of it (the font was pretty big, so it was probably more like 200). And I felt completely cathartic. It felt like I was a kid again, like the hell that followed my childhood was some distant future I wouldn&amp;#39;t have to face. I no longer felt like the lost kid looking for a place to belong. I felt happy once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped off at Barnes and Noble the other day to look for a book I had heard about recently. It was a long-ass book, and I&amp;#39;ve already finished half of it in a week. That&amp;#39;s more reading for fun than I&amp;#39;ve done in the past 6 years alone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this to say that reading has changed my life. And I&amp;#39;m thankful that I&amp;#39;ve found reading once again.&lt;/p&gt;

A number of questions come buzzing immediately on my drunken wits, being so doused in the very liquid of Shakespeare's intoxicating language. Was the assassination justified? To what extent was Cassius a bad man? Was Antony Machiavellian or an honorable hero? Was the puissant Cæsar truly good? To what extent did green envy play a role in the killing? 

The characters were wonderful. O! Noble Brutus! To die so on a Roman sword, in mighty honor's graces! And the suicide of dear harmless Portia left me stricken to the core. When Brutus beseeches the gods to make him worthy of such a noble wife, he was speaking from the heart. But in the end she commits suicide, being unable to take the stress of the situation. 

What else stands singular to me, is the character of Cassius. Was he truly a bad person, a psychopath, or an envy-filled man? For, certainly, he has many faults. But what about all the good things he does? Comforting Brutus genuinely after the argument in the tent? Committing loyally to the enterprise subsequent to the monstrous assassination? Fighting to the end, even choosing to die by suicide? No, I cannot think such a man wholly dishonorable. He had some redeeming virtue yet within his heart.  

And in the likewise, Antony had some dishonorable stain upon his (ostensibly) untarnished character. More specifically, in IV.1, he conspires to deprive Lepidus of his right to be a ruler alongside Antony and Octavius. He scorns him secretly, calling him a man fit to be sent on errands. Yet Lepidus, from what little we see of him, appears true and just, not to mention, as Octavius does, a valiant soldier. Antony shows him disrespect, intending to deprive him of his place in the triumvirate. 

My brain turns from the standard reading of ""Antony + Octavius = good"" and ""Brutus + Cassius + Cimber + Casca + etc = bad"". I believe there is far more complexity here that Shakespeare is letting on. And I haven't even addressed the part where Antony rouses the crowd with emotion, marshaling his oratory to exploit their worst aspects. He unleashes a hailstorm upon Rome. Was this one man, this Cæsar, worth the carnage and the veritable destruction of masses of people? Antony seems to imply so. In his speech where he drops the famous line ""Cry havoc!"", he says that the world will turn so bloody and dreadful that mothers will smile when they see their children die because it will become the custom of the time. It is almost as if Antony is fantasizing about vengeance, and in the process doesn't care about innocent people.

I have already shared my overall thoughts on my podcast but I am looking to get some other opinions to see what the general consensus is. Thank you for your time.

His website has the following description: [http://www.stevenstrogatz.com/books/infinite-powers](http://www.stevenstrogatz.com/books/infinite-powers)

""Though many of us were scared away from this essential, engrossing subject in high school and college, Steven Strogatz’s brilliantly creative, down to earth history shows that calculus is not about complexity; it’s about simplicity. It harnesses an unreal number—infinity—to tackle real world problems, breaking them down into easier ones and then reassembling the answers into solutions that feel miraculous.

&amp;#x200B;

Infinite Powers recounts how calculus tantalized and thrilled its inventors, starting with its first glimmers in ancient Greece and bringing us right up to the discovery of gravitational waves (a phenomenon predicted by calculus). Strogatz reveals how this form of math rose to the challenges of each age: how to determine the area of a circle with only sand and a stick; how to explain why Mars goes “backwards” sometimes; how to make electricity with magnets; how to ensure your rocket doesn’t miss the moon; how to turn the tide in the fight against AIDS.""

&amp;#x200B;

Excerpts from my thoughts:

Infinite Powers is an excellent book about the history of calculus. It begins in ancient Egypt and ends in the realm of quantum mechanics. All along the timeline Strogatz gives examples on how calculus was used at that particular snapshot in time. This ranges from the basics of determining the area of a circle to using Fourier series to predict events ranging from how air flows over a plane wing to the flow of blood through an artery.

This book really gave me a better understanding of where calculus came from and why it was needed. I took several calculus courses in college. I went from calculus one through differential equations and learned how to handle those types of equations. I learned how to perform all these calculations and formula manipulations but it was all very template like to me. I knew how to do certain operations but I didn’t know why I was doing them or how to get to them in a real life application.

Now that I have read through the book I have a better understanding of the reasons behind the formulas. This small bit of insight has given me the broad overview that I now realize I needed. I have always been sort of cloudy on the real meaning behind the formulas when I read them in books. I knew how to find the derivative but not really what it meant or why I would be interested in it. 

One of the main things that helped me get a grasp of how the formulas I deal with actually work was the explanation of infinitesimals. Hard word for me to say, but very helpful nonetheless. Strogatz explains them as the tiniest number that you can possibly imagine that isn’t quite zero. It’s smaller than everything but bigger than nothing. Strangely you can have some that are larger than others. So it’s the smallest thing you can think of, but there are also some that is smaller than that. A strange concept to be sure, but in the end it allows you to decide what you can ignore to only concentrate on the parts that contribute to the answer in a meaningful way.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was my first book by Strogatz and I am amazed at how he can explain calculus in such an engaging way.&lt;/p&gt;

There is one quote I've been desperately searching for to no effect. I believe it is from one of Hippolite's rants at the villa in Pavlovsk. What Hippolite says there is that knowing he will be dead in a couple of weeks he cannot comprehend how every healthy person in the world doesn't end up amassing great riches and achieving every thing they want in life.  


Any help is much appreciated, also if you think I'm crazy and there is no such thing in the novel, please speak up.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Dostoyevsky junkies,  &lt;/p&gt;

While most people prefer *Red Dragon*, *Hannibal* is the book that actually continues to give me nightmares. Harris' prose is incredibly sparse and deliberately composed to feel disassociated, detached &amp; uncaring. *Hannibal* is an alienating experience - horrific and gruesome. In the novel, he introduces Mason Verger.

Mason is a character that actually gave me nightmares when I first encountered his satanic form all those years ago. Mason continues to give me nightmares to this day, he's completely deranged, damaged, awful, wicked, inhuman, cruel, grotesque, and absolutely evil. Understanding the Verger dynasty as a metaphor for the cannabilistic and perverse elite of our lived-in world, *Hannibal* can also be viewed as a radical book. Mason Verger as the divine capitalist, as the demonic arbiter of judgement within that sociopathic system, is a layer that never ceases to floor me. 

I normally read this novel once a year and this year is no different but it is special considering it is its 20th birthday. I think it's one of the scariest novels ever written, if not the scariest one ever. Starling's alienation, Krendler's psychosexual humiliations, Mason's sick perversions and sadistic impulses, Pazzi's predestined doom, and, of course, Dr Lecter's own visceral philosophy elevates *Hannibal* into the realm of legendary in my eyes. 

Seriously - just thinking about Mason Verger is enough to petrify me forever. His deformities, his psychopathy, his morbid sexual appetites, his appalling history, his obsession, his pigs, and his torture methods are enough to send me reeling with fright. He is certainly one of the scariest characters that I've ever spent time with, that I have ever read about, and I'm not lying about the nightmares. Even my waking life is plagued with shivers every time Mason enters the page. I love feeling scared. Mason scares me and I love it.

On a lighter note, the book makes me want to visit Florence. I have saved on my phone at least a dozen pictures of Florence and Thomas Harris makes it come alive through the absurdly cursed Pazzi and with his storytelling. It seems like a tragicomic and beautiful historic city beaming with Gothic myth. Due to its place of import in the novel, I have come to desperately want to visit Florence one day and hopefully I will.

I hope others are revisiting *Hannibal* and are gladly celebrating its 20th Birthday.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, this is a weird thread, I know, but for quite a few years now, *Life of Pi* (Yann Martel) has been one of my favorite books, and it gets under my nerves when people misinterpret the ending. From blogs discussing the book to the actual goddamn movie, people CONSTANTLY talk about how the ""big twist"" of the book is that the animals aren't real at all--completely missing the point of the book: you get to choose what you believe in.

&amp;#x200B;

This message is *why* this book is my favorite, because as Pi lays out clearly: so long as the outcome is the same, why does it matter what the ""truth"" is? Choose whichever story brings you more peace/makes you happier in life. The whole point of the novel is that we don't know if the animals are real or not; we get to choose. Pi starts the book by saying ""this book will make you believe in God"", and when revealing that people can choose which story they see as the truth, he ties back to that opening with ""and so it is with God"". The book even ends by revealing that the reporters(?) chose to believe in the story with the tiger. I feel like it's pretty clear that the author kind of wants you to pick the ""less believable"" story, even.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm not religious, and the book definitely didn't make me believe in God, but the message of the story is still powerful to me in the sense that, so long as it's not hurting anyone, we don't need to get swept up in who's ""right"" about religion or stories or really anything (I'm looking at you, r/thatHappened). So when people miss this whole message and chalk the book up to, ""the animals were metaphorical all along!"", I feel like they're missing the best part of the story.

&amp;#x200B;

And if you're wondering what specifically set me off to write this (beyond the horrible injustice that was the movie), it was this blog talking about plot twists:

In general, how much damage can you live with before you return a book?

I don't want to be too much of a stickler and keep things realistic because at least hardcover books seem to get some kind of shipping damage 80-90% of the time, no matter where I order my books from or who delivers them. Worst case, a return and reorder might make things worse.

That being said, hardcover books are expensive and pretty visible showpieces, so of course I would like them to be pristine.

I would love buy local and have a look at the books in advance but I live in a non-English speaking country, so my English books have to be ordered and shipped anyway.

Here are two examples from the current delivery I'm on the fence about regarding my initial question:

https://i.imgur.com/hnAhQ8t.jpg

The abrasion is worse than on the photos but at least this one was kinda cheap at about 9 dollars and the dust jacket is fine (though I like to display books without the jacket).

https://i.imgur.com/vWflY4w.jpg

This one is worse because it's a large book and the damage is very visible, especially without the jacket. Plus, it's a 25 dollars book. Then again it is already a second delivery that is better than the first. The first one had a tear in the spine at exactly the same spot.

I've read plenty of books with songs as parts of characters and the story. But rarely manage to catch the tune that the author would have intended. It's often worse when I read with a tune as a word in another verse breaks the flow of my melody. Even on re-reads I have this issue.

Most obvious examples being Lord of the Rings, where music is a key theme all the way through the lore. Or even Game of Thrones where foreshadowing and prophesy are tucked away in a bards verse. Though this transcends just fantasy novels.

I'm not musically inclined but always feel like I'm missing out on some magic in the text when I can't pickup a song.

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong. I love the book. But I just want someone to confirm if they saw this too, or to just explain something I probably didn’t get haha.&lt;/p&gt;

He died a few years ago but I only found time now  to unpack the books and have a little read.

The oldest book is from 1937. Its called ""Der Admiral"" and was written by Eberhard Wolfgang Möller. It has ""only"" 54 Pages.
But before I could even start reading I found a little note in it that says: In true Companionship your Friend Heinz. It is signed by his Friend (I imagine). And has the Year 1939 (Christmas) left to it. So this was in World War II. It is quite Hard to read since it is written in Deutscheschrift.


Then there are 3 Books written by Janusz Meissner. 

-Das Grüne Tor   (The Green Door)

-Die Schwarze Flagge (The Black Flag)

-Die Roten Kreuze ( Red Crosses)

They were written in 1963 and are absolutly Beautiful. I can write a Summary if you want.

The rest of the ""Books"" are shortstories and are written by a Variety of Authors from GDR and USSR. The Time they were written in vary from 1953 to 1989.

Scriving is very difficult, requires a lot of education, and is really only useful when huge teams of scrivers coordinate on a handful of projects - so, much like technology in our world, magic has come to be dominated by four giant merchant houses, which have used it to found brutal, ruthless trade empires.

Since then, we have removed suggestion threads and directed their posters to this thread instead.  This tradition continues, so let's jump right in!

 **The Rules**

 * Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.

 **How to get the best recommendations**

 The most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.

Every single character was unique and well-written but most memorable for me would be Cathy and Charles; I loved how hateful and sociopathic she was, truly perfect antagonist; Yet she had her humane moments too. And Charles, man... Tragic one if you ask me. So so good.

And the part about Tom and Dessie and how their story ended; How emotional and powerful. yet sad at the same time.

I loved every page of it, man. Characterization and story is surprisingly perfect. I wanted to find its flaw but, subjectively, truly couldn&amp;#39;t. It turned out to be &amp;#39;my&amp;#39; kind of book. It&amp;#39;s a chilling, captivating read. Every single character is realistic and human with their strengths and weaknesses; I kept continuously thinking about the characters and analyzing their traits while in car, train, walking or at the lesson. I was persistently drawing parallels between the book and my own life, related to several characters on different levels.  I&amp;#39;m kinda proud to say 18 here and nobody forced me to read it (school, uni); Also, It&amp;#39;s a first Steinbeck for me, and damn... It doesn&amp;#39;t always happen that I wish I didn&amp;#39;t finish a book. This time it definitely did.&lt;/p&gt;

At first, I was very excited. I thought I’d found amazing deals on these books I’ve wanted to own for quite a while now, but had never gone through with buying because my family is in a pretty tough spot with money right now. 

But then (after buying the ebooks) I noticed something on the Amazon page for “Murder on the Orient Express”: It had a little warning sign of some sort that said people had reported *typos* in the ebook, and that the publisher had been contacted about fixing the typos.

I’ve never seen that warning sign before or since on anything else - not even on the Kindle ebooks that I’ve downloaded for free - and now I can’t find the page again. The publisher’s name is typed on the cover page of the $0.99 ebooks as “Real Epublisher”, and I guess that’s all I have to go on now.

I haven’t really had the chance to read through them yet; but, from just a couple cursory glances, I haven’t seen any serious typos. But I can’t stop thinking about it. I don’t want to think that parts of the book/books are wrong. I want to be able to trust what I’m reading.

And what I really want to know is this: What happens when an ebook publisher edits their books? Will my Kindle app do an automatic update? Or do I need to do something myself? Or have I just “missed out” on it, because I bought and downloaded it before the corrections were made?

While these omissions have been discussed before, I think enough has changed since 1997 to warrant the release of an unmodified version. No disrespect to the original translation (which works quite well), but there are a few reasons why the book deserves a revisit, and why doing so would be a viable option:

1) Haruki Murakami is a more internationally renowned name, with much more marketability.

2) *Wind-Up Bird* remains one of Murakami’s most acclaimed works.

3) The deleted content adds context to the characters (&gt;!the very act of burning Kumiko’s clothing adds a significant layer to Mr. Wind-Up Bird!&lt;).

4) *1Q84* dwarfs even a completed version of *Wind-Up Bird*, suggesting that length is no longer a primary concern.

5) According to Rubin himself, a completed translation already exists:

“Afraid that they would hire some freelancer who could wreak havoc on the novel, and filled with a megalomaniac certainty that I knew every word in the book--maybe better than the author himself--after having translated all three hefty volumes, I decided to forestall the horror by submitting my manuscript in two versions: complete, and cut. Knopf took my cut version pretty much as is...”

6) Reception to Murakami’s latest books seems more critical. Now might be a good time to remind sceptics of what made him worth paying attention to.

7) Considering Killing Commendatore released not too long ago, this could supplement the gap until his next novel. 

I’m sure there are many more reasons an uncut version of *Wind-Up Bird* is well deserved. However, I am aware that there would be complications, most notably that any such re-release would inevitably have limited sales. While I’m not a publisher, I see two possible ways of countering this:

1) Release a limited print, hardcover edition. Perhaps get an introduction from Murakami himself and/or the translators. Make a fancy cover, call it an ‘Anniversary’ or ‘Collector’s’ Edition and charge a premium.

2) Release it digitally.

It seems to me that Murakami is enough of a marketable name, and this book is special to enough people, that one of these options should be capable of giving us what we want while still turning a profit. 

However, herein lies the major roadblock: convincing Knopf that we want it.

It seems a pretty safe assumption that an uncut re-release would never cross Knopf’s mind without demand. Alas, it does not seem like Knopf provides any viable method of showing such demand. I visited their ‘contact us’ page, and the only thing that comes close is a generic webmaster address that likely leads to a virtual dumpster. I sent a request regardless, but surely there must be a superior method of contact.

Ultimately I am only one person, and big publishers do not budge for individual consumers. If you share my desire for an unaltered version of *Wind-Up Bird*, please consider a method by which we might contact Knopf and show them that support for this does exist; show them that this is not only something we want, but something that we are willing to spend money on. If English is not your native language, consider that most translations seem to derive from the English one.

I believe that seeing an uncut version of this book, while improbable, is not impossible. I don’t know what it will take to get Knopf’s attention – hell, as I’ve said, I don’t even know *how* – but I want to do *something* to make this desire a reality. I hope that in making this post, I can inspire others to do the same.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not a secret that the present English translation of Haruki Murakami’s &lt;em&gt;The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; is, among other modifications, missing chapters and pages. While these omissions have been discussed before, I think enough has changed since 1997 to warrant the release of an unmodified version. No disrespect to the original translation (which works quite well), but there are a few reasons why the book deserves a revisit, and why doing so would be a viable option:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Haruki Murakami is a more internationally renowned name, with much more marketability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;em&gt;Wind-Up Bird&lt;/em&gt; remains one of Murakami’s most acclaimed works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) The deleted content adds context to the characters (&lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;the very act of burning Kumiko’s clothing adds a significant layer to Mr. Wind-Up Bird&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) &lt;em&gt;1Q84&lt;/em&gt; dwarfs even a completed version of &lt;em&gt;Wind-Up Bird&lt;/em&gt;, suggesting that length is no longer a primary concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) According to Rubin himself, a completed translation already exists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Afraid that they would hire some freelancer who could wreak havoc on the novel, and filled with a megalomaniac certainty that I knew every word in the book--maybe better than the author himself--after having translated all three hefty volumes, I decided to forestall the horror by submitting my manuscript in two versions: complete, and cut. Knopf took my cut version pretty much as is...”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) Reception to Murakami’s latest books seems more critical. Now might be a good time to remind sceptics of what made him worth paying attention to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) Considering Killing Commendatore released not too long ago, this could supplement the gap until his next novel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure there are many more reasons an uncut version of &lt;em&gt;Wind-Up Bird&lt;/em&gt; is well deserved. However, I am aware that there would be complications, most notably that any such re-release would inevitably have limited sales. While I’m not a publisher, I see two possible ways of countering this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Release a limited print, hardcover edition. Perhaps get an introduction from Murakami himself and/or the translators. Make a fancy cover, call it an ‘Anniversary’ or ‘Collector’s’ Edition and charge a premium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Release it digitally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that Murakami is enough of a marketable name, and this book is special to enough people, that one of these options should be capable of giving us what we want while still turning a profit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, herein lies the major roadblock: convincing Knopf that we want it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems a pretty safe assumption that an uncut re-release would never cross Knopf’s mind without demand. Alas, it does not seem like Knopf provides any viable method of showing such demand. I visited their ‘contact us’ page, and the only thing that comes close is a generic webmaster address that likely leads to a virtual dumpster. I sent a request regardless, but surely there must be a superior method of contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately I am only one person, and big publishers do not budge for individual consumers. If you share my desire for an unaltered version of &lt;em&gt;Wind-Up Bird&lt;/em&gt;, please consider a method by which we might contact Knopf and show them that support for this does exist; show them that this is not only something we want, but something that we are willing to spend money on. If English is not your native language, consider that most translations seem to derive from the English one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that seeing an uncut version of this book, while improbable, is not impossible. I don’t know what it will take to get Knopf’s attention – hell, as I’ve said, I don’t even know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; – but I want to do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; to make this desire a reality.

Like 3 years ago, although I can't find a copy of it on bookstores and only just stumbled upon this novel by accident during a bookfair. During those times, I am trying to foresee on what I should read and what happens to the story, characters, etc. while trying to avoid spoilers. Now that I've finished it, boy did it exceed my expectations.

The characters, places, the prose, everything was beautiful as it is. All of the characters at the novel seemed interesting and memorable as they are. The most memorable being Judge Holden. The novel itself, though seeming as violent as it is, is just where the beauty and the message in it lies. The violence and beauty intersect together until you see them as one. This novel also put me through a rollercoaster of emotions. For example, at the first parts of the novel does it paint to the reader a picture of how violent and savage the Indians were, it tells you certain foreshadowings, and forms of allegory. I felt that the indians were as vicious as they are or crude as they seem at the first parts of the novel, then as the novel progresses towards the victories of the Glanton gang, and ideals and views of the Judge, did I empathize with the so called ""savages"" themselves and see them as the true victims here.
Aside from those things mentioned above, the novel leaves an impactful message as to how society is. The allegories and/or meanings hinted and mentioned at the novel also paints an idea about how things can be viewed and treated. I find myself agreeing with most of what the Judge says even though he can be called as this madman, while at the same time agreeing with the rebuttals or the exchanges of the characters with him. I'd say that this novel is a solid 10/10 for me. It's definitely Cormac McCarthy's magnum opus.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off, I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to buy this novel since way back after a thread I read.

 And yes, I actually like cliffhangers, even if most people don't seem to like them. They give YOU the choice to end the story, in your own imagination. Do you want the main character to make  this or that choice ? You can do that, because the author doesn't tell you the ending, therefore it can be whatever you want it to be.

My least favourite is definitely an epilogue, I just can't really enjoy them. They do the exact opposite of a cliffhanger, and give you no choice but to accept exactly what ending the author wants. Like, most of the time, you get a whole family and kids to your main character, even if you didn't want them to even end up with a specific love interest.

I’m not a big reader and I picked up this book and *Rainbow Six* a couple years back.  I immediately read *Rainbow Six* and loved it, but got busy and hadn’t gotten around to reading *Red October* because I got busy.  I just binge-read it (if that’s a thing) in under a week and lemme tell ya: it was awesome!

I finished the last 150 pages today and I loved the ending.  That was my biggest gripe about *Rainbow Six* — I felt like the ending was a bit unrealistic.  *Red October*’s ending, on the other hand, while a bit over-the-top, felt believable.  I loved Ramirez as a character, as well as Jones and Mancuso.  The only major complaint is that with so many characters, it got really hard to keep track of the minor ones (i.e. Greer, Pelt, Padorin, etc.).  I really just stopped paying attention to their roles by the end.  Also, I wish there had been some more explanation as to what some of the words meant (like “conn”, I have no clue what that means).  I guess I could google it but I’m too lazy at this point.

I also watched the movie right after an that was a disappointment.   I guess with a book as long as *Red October* you can’t really cram it into a 2 hour film.   The movie left out a lot of key plot points and would probably be very confusing to see if you hadn’t read the book already.  I also didn’t like it because it took my favorite character, Ramius, and made him into an arrogant and mean old man.  In the book he is much more friendly, especially to his officers and enlisted sailors, and isn’t as arrogant as he is smart and clever.  Other than that though, a decent film, and an even better book.

The other issue I had — or not so much an issue as a comment — was that I really don’t get what the fuss is with Jack Ryan.  I know a lot of people love him and I saw in other threads people recommending to read all of the books about him, but I dunno.  His character wasn’t very relatable, and he was kinda a baby throughout the whole thing, not really doing much except for his analysis in the beginning and the shootout in the end.  I would much rather read another book about Ramius than another about Jack Ryan, but that’s just me.

I give it a 8.5/10.  I personally liked *Rainbow Six* better because it has more action, but it’s 100% personal preference.  *Red October* is definitely more realistic and I can appreciate that.

Let me preface this by saying that I am a daily reader and a lover of reading. I read both for pleasure and for my studies  in university which gives me LOTS of material to read. I recently noticed that I often spend much more time than my peers finishing reading assignments - by a lot. I read more than most people I know but I do not cover much ground. I roughly estimated my reading speed today and came out at a measly 160 wpm. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and began taking medication which helps the intensity of my focus, but my reading speed has not changed significantly. What makes me particularly slow I think is that I regularly find that in the middle of my reading I have no idea what the last paragraph about, and I often have to re-read sentences or paragraphs.

This is becoming a massive hindrance to finishing all of the reading I have to do for school, I was wondering If any readers out there have had similar experiences and if so how can I work towards increasing my speed. Thank you!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello &lt;a href=""/r/books""&gt;r/books&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me preface this by saying that I am a daily reader and a lover of reading. I read both for pleasure and for my studies  in university which gives me LOTS of material to read. I recently noticed that I often spend much more time than my peers finishing reading assignments - by a lot. I read more than most people I know but I do not cover much ground. I roughly estimated my reading speed today and came out at a measly 160 wpm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and began taking medication which helps the intensity of my focus, but my reading speed has not changed significantly. What makes me particularly slow I think is that I regularly find that in the middle of my reading I have no idea what the last paragraph about, and I often have to re-read sentences or paragraphs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is becoming a massive hindrance to finishing all of the reading I have to do for school, I was wondering If any readers out there have had similar experiences and if so how can I work towards increasing my speed. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

I suspect Tayari Jones' *An American Marriage* will stand the test of time.  It is fiction based on a black man in the South who is falsely accused of rape and sent to prison, but it that isn't really the point of the novel. Instead it is ultimately about marriage and how it survives (or doesn't) a trying situation and how subtle or explicit racism can be.

It let me know there were creative ways to be and live in nature.

I loved the simplicity of it even if it was all quite terrifying for child me to imagine living without my Mom and Dad alone in the woods taking care of my siblings.

Island of the Blue Dolphins did the same, and it planted in me this huge desire to live in isolation, to make and grow and be a strong emotional part of the world in which I lived. To be critical of strangers with false smiles over evil eyes. To embrace the worst periods of your life in a way and make the best of them. To find solace in times of grief, companionship in the strangest of places as well as through barriers of communication. A strong respect for the dead. For death, for the brevity of life.

Today I reached the halfway mark!

Part of the reason I chose this challenge for myself is simply because I love to read. But more than that, it’s because I can think of no better way to improve as a writer. I’ve learned so much about the craft in the past year—let alone the past five months—and I’ve really enjoyed getting to know all of these authors. (Well maybe not all of them—looking at you, Salinger.)

These are my six favorite reads so far, (because I couldn’t decide on number five). If you see any of your favorites, let me know in the comments!

1. “All The Light We Cannot See” by Anthony Doerr.
2. “The Things They Carried” by Tim O’Brien.
3. “Frankenstein” by Mary Shelley
4. “Lolita” by Vladimir Nabokov
5. “In Harm’s Way” by Doug Stanton
6. “Treasure Island” by Robert Louis Stevenson

Honorable mentions to “A Man Called Ove” by Fredrick Bachman, “All Quiet on the Western Front” by Erich Maria Remarque, “Sh\*t My Dad Says” by Justin Halpern, “City of Thieves” by that assclown David Benioff, and “The Pianist” by Wladyslaw Szpilman.

I’ve been able to read so much more this year by replacing a lot of my phone time with reading (ironic, I know) and the same with aimless TV watching (as opposed to turning on the TV to watch something specific). I also try to get an audiobook version of the book I’m reading from the library so I can “read” on my way to and from work.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: A lot of people have asked how I retain information from the books I read. Great question! This is certainly something I've worried about. The best thing for me has been writing my own summary and ""review"" in an Evernote folder just after finishing the book, or a few days after. I don't do it with every book I read, but definitely with the ones I really like. When I write the review, I do it in the author's own prose. I find that this method is also a great writing exercise. For an example, here's my ""review in borrowed prose"" of Frankenstein:

&gt;Oh! only that I could portray adequately, dear friends, the utmost love and affection that I hold thither my heart for a tale such as this. Poor Frankenstein’s daemon, the miserable wretch! 

&amp;#x200B;

And a considerably longer “review in borrowed prose” for a book I **didn't** like, The Catcher in the Rye:

&gt;Overall I think this story is a whole big bunch of baloney. This Salinger guy, he just really can’t seem to get to the point. The whole thing just crawls all over the place and doesn’t really go *any*where. Boy, I hate it when a story doesn’t go anywhere. Really, it makes me mad as hell.   
&gt;  
&gt;I get that some people think it's grand. I get it. I really do. This guy I knew back in school, Ritchie Whitcore, he thought it was real grand. They made us all read it for a book report, the whole goddam class. I don’t remember a good bit, to tell you the truth. I was busy looking at old Jane in the row in front of me. She wore these dresses that were tight around the middle and boy, I just couldn’t get enough of her. She turned me into a madman, honest. Anyway, we finished this damn book and I thought I was gonna die I was so bored from it. But old Ritchie said that he thought it was interesting, how “Holden’s story represents a teenager’s struggle between the flightiness of childhood and the unpleasant responsibility of becoming an adult.” That killed me. Some people can just go on and on and on about anything. The teacher, Mrs. Dunmore, she really loved it. She just ate it up. What a bunch of phonies.  
&gt;  
&gt;I mean I guess I under*stand* what he meant. The story overall is kind of neat in the way old Salinger shows how a teenager might think. But *boy*, does it crawl all over the place. All those parts about nothing made me wanna scoop my old eyeballs out. Really, they did. I'd probably smoke a hundred cigarettes for every goddam page of this book if I had to read it by myself. Boy, it was really lousy a lot of the time.  
&gt;  
&gt;The one thing old Salinger got right though, if you want to know, is the way he tells the whole thing. I sure hate when a story doesn’t go anywhere, but sometimes—even if a writer’s a big phony overall—I can like how they talk. Sallinger, he could talk like a real genius, if you want to know the truth. He really could. I knew this guy in sixth grade who was about the biggest phony I ever met. I wouldn't believe a word out of him. But boy, could he talk. He could talk so good you had to love the guy even though you knew he was such a phony. That’s what this Salinger guy does. Half the time I just want to smack him in his old head when I think about how this story doesn’t go any goddam where. But boy, the way he *talks* I can’t help but like him. I’m not sayin I love the guy or whatever, but I do like the way he talks in the book. That’s about the only thing I like. That and how it does a good job at showing how a teenager might think. But boy, this whole book isn't about a goddam thing. It really isn’t.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 1st I decided to try to read 100 books this year.

(Well maybe not all of them—looking at you, Salinger.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are my six favorite reads so far, (because I couldn’t decide on number five). If you see any of your favorites, let me know in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“All The Light We Cannot See” by Anthony Doerr.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The Things They Carried” by Tim O’Brien.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Frankenstein” by Mary Shelley&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Lolita” by Vladimir Nabokov&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“In Harm’s Way” by Doug Stanton&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Treasure Island” by Robert Louis Stevenson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honorable mentions to “A Man Called Ove” by Fredrick Bachman, “All Quiet on the Western Front” by Erich Maria Remarque, “Sh*t My Dad Says” by Justin Halpern, “City of Thieves” by that assclown David Benioff, and “The Pianist” by Wladyslaw Szpilman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been able to read so much more this year by replacing a lot of my phone time with reading (ironic, I know) and the same with aimless TV watching (as opposed to turning on the TV to watch something specific). I also try to get an audiobook version of the book I’m reading from the library so I can “read” on my way to and from work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: A lot of people have asked how I retain information from the books I read. Great question! This is certainly something I&amp;#39;ve worried about. The best thing for me has been writing my own summary and &amp;quot;review&amp;quot; in an Evernote folder just after finishing the book, or a few days after. I don&amp;#39;t do it with every book I read, but definitely with the ones I really like. When I write the review, I do it in the author&amp;#39;s own prose. I find that this method is also a great writing exercise. For an example, here&amp;#39;s my &amp;quot;review in borrowed prose&amp;quot; of Frankenstein:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh! only that I could portray adequately, dear friends, the utmost love and affection that I hold thither my heart for a tale such as this. Poor Frankenstein’s daemon, the miserable wretch! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a considerably longer “review in borrowed prose” for a book I &lt;strong&gt;didn&amp;#39;t&lt;/strong&gt; like, The Catcher in the Rye:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I think this story is a whole big bunch of baloney. This Salinger guy, he just really can’t seem to get to the point. The whole thing just crawls all over the place and doesn’t really go &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt;where. Boy, I hate it when a story doesn’t go anywhere. Really, it makes me mad as hell.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get that some people think it&amp;#39;s grand. I get it. I really do. This guy I knew back in school, Ritchie Whitcore, he thought it was real grand. They made us all read it for a book report, the whole goddam class. I don’t remember a good bit, to tell you the truth. I was busy looking at old Jane in the row in front of me. She wore these dresses that were tight around the middle and boy, I just couldn’t get enough of her. She turned me into a madman, honest. Anyway, we finished this damn book and I thought I was gonna die I was so bored from it. But old Ritchie said that he thought it was interesting, how “Holden’s story represents a teenager’s struggle between the flightiness of childhood and the unpleasant responsibility of becoming an adult.” That killed me. Some people can just go on and on and on about anything. The teacher, Mrs. Dunmore, she really loved it. She just ate it up. What a bunch of phonies.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean I guess I under&lt;em&gt;stand&lt;/em&gt; what he meant. The story overall is kind of neat in the way old Salinger shows how a teenager might think. But &lt;em&gt;boy&lt;/em&gt;, does it crawl all over the place. All those parts about nothing made me wanna scoop my old eyeballs out. Really, they did. I&amp;#39;d probably smoke a hundred cigarettes for every goddam page of this book if I had to read it by myself. Boy, it was really lousy a lot of the time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing old Salinger got right though, if you want to know, is the way he tells the whole thing. I sure hate when a story doesn’t go anywhere, but sometimes—even if a writer’s a big phony overall—I can like how they talk. Sallinger, he could talk like a real genius, if you want to know the truth. He really could. I knew this guy in sixth grade who was about the biggest phony I ever met. I wouldn&amp;#39;t believe a word out of him. But boy, could he talk. He could talk so good you had to love the guy even though you knew he was such a phony. That’s what this Salinger guy does. Half the time I just want to smack him in his old head when I think about how this story doesn’t go any goddam where. But boy, the way he &lt;em&gt;talks&lt;/em&gt; I can’t help but like him. I’m not sayin I love the guy or whatever, but I do like the way he talks in the book. That’s about the only thing I like. That and how it does a good job at showing how a teenager might think. But boy, this whole book isn&amp;#39;t about a goddam thing. It really isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

Do you have a favorite publisher? Not many people really talk about publishers like this. So in pursuit of this curiosity of certain publishers, I mapped out a timeline of their evolution showing when publishing houses began, merged and where they are now. It gave me a good visual of how these company names came to be when I look at their title page with their name on the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

[Evolution of The Publishers](https://imgur.com/7smRFkO) I hope this is clear enough as it was confusing. I could not put in every last detail. I focused on the large publishers which there seems to be 5 or 6, depending on who is counting. I thought running vertical would be easier to see, but I laid it out [horizontally](https://imgur.com/a/i6Q4tUg) if you think this is easier to look out.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have a favorite publisher? Not many people really talk about publishers like this. So in pursuit of this curiosity of certain publishers, I mapped out a timeline of their evolution showing when publishing houses began, merged and where they are now. It gave me a good visual of how these company names came to be when I look at their title page with their name on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/7smRFkO""&gt;Evolution of The Publishers&lt;/a&gt; I hope this is clear enough as it was confusing. I could not put in every last detail. I focused on the large publishers which there seems to be 5 or 6, depending on who is counting. I thought running vertical would be easier to see, but I laid it out &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/i6Q4tUg""&gt;horizontally&lt;/a&gt; if you think this is easier to look out.  Hopefully it all makes sense and there are not too many errors.&lt;/p&gt;

This work doesn't really get the traction of his other works, but I definitely think it's well worth your time to read if you're a fan of his other works. Since this was his first novel, you can feel him honing his style, but so many of the classic Vonnegut-isms were there. 

The dystopian genre is crowded and the 'technology as a threat' genre is definitely well-worn, but one aspect of this story that I greatly appreciated was that Vonnegut never let us forget that human beings were in charge of the machines. It was people who designed and built the machines that dictated and rationalized so much of public life. Nor was it particularly evil in its origin. The machines were a natural extension of our own desire to create devices to make our lives better and easier and it became easier to rationalize automated processes taking over for human labor as the error rate is so much lower and the product objectively better and cheaper. Nevertheless, the end result was a world in which people had most if not all of their basic needs met, but were also alienated at this existence as they didn't have the agency to pursue lives of our own choosing. 

It was pretty apparent that he was still finding his voice as a writer as the book had a few problems. There are some plotholes, the female characters are extremely poorly written,  the Shah travels America plotline probably doesn't read that well in 2019. I don't think it was a particularly funny book, at least not compared to some of his later works. But you can tell that the wit and wisdom is there. I feel like Vonnegut sometimes writes like he's just a nice guy who knows a lot of random things and through his side characters he just gives us these random pieces knowledge that he's picked up somewhere in his life knowing that he has a captive audience. I don't even know if they're true or not, they very well might not be, which would be even funnier.

This is a quality that I would like to see more attention towards as I firmly believe that it is one of the distinguishing factors between a good author, and a great one.

**What do I mean?**

What I mean by clearly and concisely communicating space, position, and movement, is the ability of an author to deliver all of the relevant information to the reader about the space in which a scene is set, the position of everything in that space, and the movement of everything through that space. 

**In Practice**

This starts off simple, basic, X person walked through Y door and sat in Z chair. But this is where the *relevant* part comes into play, relevant information is *any* piece of information about something's space, position, or movement which is necessary for the reader to know in order to understand what happens in the space.
Let's start with just looking at position, (and a minimal amount of space because information about the space is necessary for even a basic understanding of the scene) in a very basic manner and use the example of a baseball bat. If you hit someone with a baseball bat, that bat can't come from thin air, either someone brought it into the space, or it was there already and they grabbed it, either way the reader needs to know that the baseball bat was present before it was used. So what we would need to know is 

* The dimensions of the space

* The position of the characters within the space

* The position of the bat in the space

Essentially this is Chekhov's Gun in reverse, if a gun is fired in a story, it must be shown at some point beforehand. Now this is all still very basic stuff, but this is with just position and space, and in a very basic form. Let's go back to the baseball bat, this time fleshing it out. Let's assume that the baseball bat is present in the space already. Looking at position, the relevant information would be:

* The dimensions of the space

* The position of the characters, in relation to the space, each other, and the bat

* The position of the bat in relation to the space and the characters

* The dimensions of anything in between the characters and the bat

* The position of anything in between the characters and the bat in relation to the space, the characters, the bat, and anything else in between the characters and the bat

* The dimensions of anything in between the characters and each other

* The position of anything in between the characters and each other in relation to the space, the characters, and anything else in between the characters and each other

As you can see it gets complex very quickly, however, all of this can be taken care of with a description that includes all of the information required to figure this out for yourself, In reality, something like this would work: 
Person A and Person B are sitting in a small, square room. There is window on the wall opposite the entrance, there is a bank of chairs along the left wall, there are two side tables, one on either side of the bank of chairs, each with a lamp on top, and a basket containing some magazines below, on the right wall there is a closed door which leads into an office, against the closer side table rests a baseball bat. Person A and Person B are sitting on opposite ends of the bank of chairs. 

It isn't particularly hard to cover your bases, you just need to plan accordingly, however this is still missing a key part of the picture.

**Movement**

Up to this point we've only been looking at position and space. But position and space aren't generally where I see most authors fail, chances are that if you're a half decent author, you have those figured out. Where most people falter, is movement. Without movement you have a picture of a single moment, frozen in time, adding it in necessitates that you not only consider a third layer of relevant information, but also that you communicate the way that information changes. It is important to communicate not only the movement, but how the positions of everything within the space change in response, and if necessary, how the space itself changes in response. If changing the space is a bit hard to grasp, think of the ""The Floor is Down"" moment in Ender's Game.

Many authors just don't manage to keep track of both the movement and the response, but even for those that do, there is another obstacle to conquer.

**The Tunnel**

Most good authors make it to this point, where *they* fail is a rather insidious pitfall which I am going to refer to as tunnel vision. Where Tunnel Vision always seems to rear it's ugly head is in battle scenes, Tunnel Vision is where the focus narrows to a small part of the scene, to the detriment of the whole. If we're talking battle scenes, what you tend to see is: X swings their sword, Y blocks with their shield, X scratches Y's arm, Y decapitates X. 

The problem here is that the focus of the scene narrows to the upper bodies of two people, to the exclusion of literally everything else. Not only is it boring, but it lacks any information about the two characters' movement through the space, their positions at any point in time, or the movement of anything besides whichever arm is the current focal point.  This leads not only to scenes which are confusing to follow because the reader has suddenly been disconnected from the space, and any sense of position within it, but also to a jarring break of their immersion when they have to try and figure out how someone fell off the balcony, when the last thing they remember, everyone was at the bottom of the stairs. 

**The Force Carrier**

Effective communication of position, space, and movement is different, not in that it lacks the same level of focus, but in what that focus is directed at, and in that it is less narrowed, if not by much. Instead of the focus being on the action, the movement, the focus is on the what I call the Force Carrier. The Force Carrier is whatever bridges one action to it's corresponding reaction, and then whatever bridges the reaction to the reaction, and so on, In a fight scene, for example, the action could be a punch, the carrier could be a block, and the reaction could be the person who blocked, stumbling back from the force of the block. In a more extended example you could have a fight where each blow is redirected to the advantage of the defender, whose redirection leads into an attack, which is the redirected back at them. The carrier is a vehicle for keeping the focus of the scene on whatever is the most important part of said scene, with each focus transitioning to a new one as the scene shifts. This allows the fight to be one uninterrupted sequence, as opposed to a disconnected stop and start, and with every important action leading to the next, it becomes much more difficult to miss important details and end up confused when they come into play.

The best example that comes to mind is from Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn, It is Kelsier's fight against a group of foes, in a noble family's keep, involving a heavy metal paperweight, It is a fantastic example of how to create a flow of cause and effect in a fight, and is a fantastic example of effective communication of position, space, and movement working in tandem to immerse the reader and communicate effectively.

TL;DR:
* Give the reader the information necessary to visualize the space, and the positions and movement of anything within.
* Remember, Your characters have legs, use them!
* Each important action should lead to the next.

Hopefully I explained this in a clear enough manner, if anyone has any suggestions I would love to hear them

I really enjoyed how bizarre this true crime story was, but mostly how Wallace didn't just describe a heist, he weaved history, memoir, science, and true crime together to create a beautifully written non-fiction. After seeing [u/conservio](https://www.reddit.com/u/conservio/) [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/bc2sb8/my_library_offers_a_customized_reading_list_here/) here about asking their local librarian for personal recommendations I did the same and was recommended The Orchid Thief by Susan Orlean. I emailed the librarian who sent me the recs saying thank you and he said he wanted to recommend one more book, The Library Book by Susan Orlean. I decided to read that asap since his recommendation was glowing.

Anyways, I just finished it over the weekend and wow! It's about so much more than the fire that happened at LA Central Library in 1986 (which I didn't know about before reading the book), and I think that's what I love so much about it. Orlean does talk about the fire/aftermath/crime, but also writes a broader story about the history of libraries in the US and a little bit around the world, the colorful history of the LA Central library (honestly never thought any library history would be all that interesting but I was wrong!), the day-to-day life of librarians and other library related jobs, Orlean's personal connection to the library, and the cultural significance of libraries. It also happens to be a beautiful book.

I didn't realize people call their local libraries for answers to simple questions (or philosophical questions like what is more evil a grasshopper or cicada, I can't remember the exact quote from the book but you get the idea), or how to restore water-logged books, or that the LA Central library is almost 150 years old. My best friend is a librarian and I have a much deeper appreciation for what she does and what libraries do for the community in general, something I don't think I would have developed without reading this book! Has anyone else read it??

After seeing &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/u/conservio/""&gt;u/conservio&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/bc2sb8/my_library_offers_a_customized_reading_list_here/""&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; here about asking their local librarian for personal recommendations I did the same and was recommended The Orchid Thief by Susan Orlean. I emailed the librarian who sent me the recs saying thank you and he said he wanted to recommend one more book, The Library Book by Susan Orlean. I decided to read that asap since his recommendation was glowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I just finished it over the weekend and wow! It&amp;#39;s about so much more than the fire that happened at LA Central Library in 1986 (which I didn&amp;#39;t know about before reading the book), and I think that&amp;#39;s what I love so much about it. Orlean does talk about the fire/aftermath/crime, but also writes a broader story about the history of libraries in the US and a little bit around the world, the colorful history of the LA Central library (honestly never thought any library history would be all that interesting but I was wrong!), the day-to-day life of librarians and other library related jobs, Orlean&amp;#39;s personal connection to the library, and the cultural significance of libraries. It also happens to be a beautiful book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t realize people call their local libraries for answers to simple questions (or philosophical questions like what is more evil a grasshopper or cicada, I can&amp;#39;t remember the exact quote from the book but you get the idea), or how to restore water-logged books, or that the LA Central library is almost 150 years old. My best friend is a librarian and I have a much deeper appreciation for what she does and what libraries do for the community in general, something I don&amp;#39;t think I would have developed without reading this book! Has anyone else read it??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

I was thinking maybe she would redeemed herself by the end of the story, but nope. Throughout the rest of the book I felt awful for hating the main character. Am I just not understanding female lead now? Is this how strong woman really act? Frankly I almost felt like I have become a misogynist, somehow.

The story itself has so much potential in my opinion. I still like the Artemis bubbles concept, the political drama and even some of the side characters.

The characters felt very real, and the story of being lost in your own world and problems while the world was falling apart around you, slowly encroaching on the life you knew is a classic tale of youth. The desperate attempt to hold onto the life you knew before being thrust into adulthood is universal and poweful. The friendship, and possible romance, between Finny and Gene is emotional and beautiful, and when the book ends the journeys of both characters directly reflects the themes the novel has been building upon.

Usually after I finish reading a book, any piece of media, really, I look online to see what others thought. To my surprise, the book was highly divisive. Many people despise this book, and it surprised me. 

SPOILERS FOLLOW

The biggest criticisms seem to be about how unrelatable the characters and their problems are. They are rich, priviledged white boys who are effectively avoiding WW2 by going to a private school. While yes, the setting is something most of us have never and will never see, that does not invalidate the central message, being robbed of one's youth and being thrust into adulthood, whether they are ready or not. The idea that books have to be relatable to have value is  an school of thought that I dislike. While the story may not be 'relatable' on a surface level, the theme is universal. At one point or another, we have to grow up. It happens at different times for all of us, as it does for all of us. The character that represents eternal youth, Finny, was damaged at the end of summer, and by the end of winter he is dead, effectively ending Gene's childhood and bringing him into adulthood.

When I started reading the novel, I knew absolutely nothing about it. So when it came to Finny and Gene's relationship, I was surprised by how homoerotic it was. Personally, I read it with a queer theory lense, and to me that really enhanced my reading experience. Gene constantly wrestles with his feelings for Finny. He does not understand if he is a friend or a rival, but Gene feels a strong pull toward him, and ultimately succumbs to Finny's endless charms. This wrestling of emotions during a time of great change.is something I imagine young LGBTQ+ people deal with constantly. Especially at a time where gay relationships were uncommon, Gene's entanglement with Finny being something he cannot put into words becomes much more powerful. He feels somwthing for Finny that he cannot understand, and this causes him to act irrationally. Whether or not you see the relationship as romantic or platonic, it is a striking one, and it is undeniable how Gene's love and loss of Finny is what causes him to fall into his cold, depressing adulthood. 

So yeah, just a few unfocused thought on *A Seperate Peace.* I am curious to see what r/books has to say about it. As is probably clear, I loved it, and a few tears my have been shed at the sudden death of Finny... but enough about that. What do you guys think? I'd love to see what you guys think, and hopefully have a discussion with you all about our thoughts, because love it or hate it I think it's a book worth talking about.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently decided that I was going to read the high school &amp;#39;staples&amp;#39; that I never read in school, such as &lt;em&gt;1984&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein.&lt;/em&gt; As the title states, a couple of weeks ago I finished John Knowles&amp;#39; classic piece of YA fiction, &lt;em&gt;A Seperate Peace.&lt;/em&gt; Personally, I loved it.

I just finished reading it and God damn I was filled with a plethora of emotions. The atmosphere,the protagonist and his life were explained in an indirect way but it was nevertheless so detailed that I felt like I was in a post-apocalyptic California. 

The protagonist's past life was shrouded in mystery in the beginning. The story itself progressed like layers,first we get to know how he scavenges for supplies and barricades himself at night. His intricate tactics to protect himself at night and his gradual descent into insanity upon realising that he was alone was so meticulously written by the author that I was like ""woah"" then gradually we get to discover his godforsaken past, his family, how the vampires were created the government's cruel ways to curb it and the religious superstition that were formed along were explained not in one go but slowly, which gave a sense of satisfaction as I got to know more about him

What stood out to me the most was the scientific explanation for vampires. You see, instead of zombies in the movies, which I later learned there was one after googling it after read the book, there were vampires. When the protagonist regained his senses he began to learn more and more about them. All the mythological aspects of vampires like their fear of the Cross and garlic and how they were vulnerable in daytime were supported with a scientific explanation which was like, way ahead of it's time. Remember this book was published almost 60 years ago. To be daring enough to take a new path in the sci fi genre was one of the things that made me love the author.

My only gripe was with the ending. The story had been slowly progressing like a roller coaster of emotions and just when it reached it's peak, it plummeted down. They author intoduced a new ""faction""(not spoiling it though) which I felt,was rushed up. The ending however, despite being sad, had a deep moral behind it- ""when the entire world is ruled by chaos, never trust a man as the values that make humans, humans are thrown out of the window."" This was what I learned at the end.

Last but not the least, after learning that the movie featured zombies instead of the vampires that were crafted with scientific research by the author, I feet this as a betrayal to the book and the author's legacy. I vowed never to see the movie.

For those who don't know light novels are basically Japanese novels with some very limited illustrations. They're usually shorter than conventional novels and the plot is usually extended over several volumes. 

I feel like i enjoy light novels more than conventional novels. There's just something very different about the way they're written. They don't feel overly atmospheric or in a way full of themselves, like they aren't novels. They feel more personal like your reading an overly long letter from friend if that makes sense.   

My favorite author is Nishio Ishin, author of the monogatari series and his works are fascinating. Especially his characters The way they talk and behave. They don't feel real, but that does't take away from the enjoyment at all, in fact the opposite. He could spend an entire chapter talking nonsense about someone's panties and yet its still amazing. The plot also seems to revolve about something and nothing at the same time and in the end everything just seems to resolve itself. His works give off the feeling of being extremely lazy but are in fact genius. To me they feel like a fairy tale, and his characters feel bubbly if that makes sense.  

Another light novel is the ""Empty Box and the Zeroth Maria"" series which is also amazing in its own right for being tightly woven and extremely clever.

If anyone has read a light novel please let me know how you would compare them to conventional novels and how they're different and why you think its ok for them to operate under different rules and still end up enjoyable.

Now after a bit of a reading hiatus i find myself enjoying and getting into it again but i can't feel it anymore no matter how many different books i've read since.
I finished Dune today for example and i really loved the story i was in from start to finish binging it in less than two days and couldn't wait to see what happens but now that it's over i just don't feel like i was in the desert with them you know, it's just like someone told me a great story but i didn't live it with these fictional friends, i didn't feel sad when some of them died, i just felt the wow effect of surprise but no emotion.

I can't tell if i'm depressed or if getting older makes you feel less.

The world itself is fascinating, being similar to a late 1700's Venice and while technically a fantasy setting, the fantasy elements add a layer of mystery and wonder to the world without subtracting from the realistic design and feel of the city in which the novel takes place.

One of my favourite aspects is how intelligence and scheming is given far more importance than fighting capability! I love how the main character is far more akin to a mastermind than the typical prophecy hero that I have seen more often nowadays, and yet he isn't the only person in the city with their own agenda, as each and every person in the novel tries to better their own lot in life! Its phenomenally written, as each persons plans interlock into a giant web of schemes and lies!

Something I am particularly impressed by is the side characters! They are all extremely well written, each being completely believable and relatable on some level, and their individual personalities matching the life choices they have made and the positions they have been put in! I really love the chemistry as well, especially between our characters main group The Gentleman Bastards, as their respective attitudes and dialogue play off each other extremely well!

Perhaps my favourite little sidebit about this novel is the magic. While their is some magic, it exists entirely to screw with the main character, which is something I personally have never seen, but wish I could see more of!

All in all, I can't recommend this novel enough! If you're looking for a breath of fresh air; something that remains in the fantasy genre but takes a far more realistic approach, then The Lies of Locke Lamora is a book that you need to check out!

S. Ramachandran. Fascinating book and super interesting to read. He recounts how his work with patients who have bizarre neurological disorders has shed new light on the deep architecture of the brain, and what these findings tell us about who we are, how we construct our body image, why we laugh or become depressed, why we may believe in God, how we make decisions, deceive ourselves and dream, perhaps even why we're so clever at philosophy, music and art. Some of his most notable cases are explored. Ramachandran is well-known and has a lot of popular readings, if you enjoy this work or the subject in general. I am not personally familiar with Sandra Blakeslee or any of her other works.

Another favorite from Ramachandran is *The Tell-Tale Brain: A Neuroscientist's Quest for What Makes Us Human* - where he ""investigates strange, unforgettable cases―from patients who believe they are dead to sufferers of phantom limb syndrome. With a storyteller’s eye for compelling case studies and a researcher’s flair for new approaches to age-old questions, Ramachandran tackles the most exciting and controversial topics in brain science, including language, creativity, and consciousness.""

Secondly, another great author on this subject, who is also prolific and well-known/respected in neuroscience, would be Oliver Sacks. He may be more popular even, as he is/was both a great scientist, but also a great narrative storyteller. He has a lot of great books published, and they are very easy to read. It's a scientific subject, but a very human perspective in discussing the cases and his patients. 

If you like this subject matter and want to dig into such but with a narrative format, rather than more textbook-esque information - check out Ramachandran, as well as Oliver Sacks' books. They are incredible really, and they both have many popular books on varying topics in the field. I have read more Sacks myself, so I'll list some of my favorites here as well:

*The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat* - ""tells the stories of individuals afflicted with fantastic perceptual and intellectual aberrations: patients who have lost their memories and with them the greater part of their pasts; who are no longer able to recognize people and common objects; who are stricken with violent tics and grimaces or who shout involuntary obscenities; whose limbs have become alien; who have been dismissed as retarded yet are gifted with uncanny artistic or mathematical talents.""

*Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain* - ""In Musicophilia, he shows us a variety of what he calls “musical misalignments.” Among them: a man struck by lightning who suddenly desires to become a pianist at the age of forty-two; an entire group of children with Williams syndrome, who are hypermusical from birth; people with “amusia,” to whom a symphony sounds like the clattering of pots and pans; and a man whose memory spans only seven seconds-for everything but music.""

*Hallucinations* - ""To many people, hallucinations imply madness, but in fact they are a common part of the human experience. These sensory distortions range from the shimmering zigzags of a visual migraine to powerful visions brought on by fever, injuries, drugs, sensory deprivation, exhaustion, or even grief. Hallucinations doubtless lie behind many mythological traditions, literary inventions, and  religious epiphanies. Drawing on his own experiences, a wealth of clinical cases from among his patients, and famous historical examples ranging from Dostoevsky to Lewis Carroll, the legendary neurologist Oliver Sacks investigates the mystery of these sensory deceptions: what they say about the working of our brains, how they have influenced our folklore and culture, and why the potential for hallucination is present in us all.""

The Japanese know how to die. That might seem an odd compliment to pay, but it's a sincere one. I'm a longtime admirer of (traditional) Japanese culture; and one of the facets of Japanese culture I admire most is their attitude to death—the restraint, equanimity and, compared to the West, lack of useless striving and pointless melodrama with which they approach the end of life. Nothing illustrates this attitude so well as the Japanese tradition of *jisei*.

As soon as I read Japanese Death Poems by Yoel Hoffman, it became my favourite poetry collection.

I initially became interested in the tradition of jisei through reading the death poems of WWII Kamikaze pilots. This book really opened up the entire world of death poetry to me, and the wider tradition of Zen poetry beside (though unfortunately few of the other Japanese poetry collections I've purchased live up to this one. Maybe it's because they're not about death.)

As someone of a rather depressive persuasion, I think a lot about death—as the Buddha said, ""Do not neglect the recollection of death"", or as the Western tradition has it, ""Memento mori."" I think these poems really show how death, rather than something frightening or ugly, can be just as beautiful as life, and how a life lived in consciousness of the imminence of death can be more beautiful because of it. Because we know that we are about to die, we are able to value our brief, transitory life. We take time to appreciate the evanescent glory of the cherry blossoms. Despite being only twenty-one, this book inspired me to write dozens of death poems of my own (I imagine I'll have a few thousand by the time I actually die—or not.) It's a remarkable exercise, which I think everyone should do. Nothing throws things into relief like the awareness of death. You soon figure out what really matter, and, perhaps more importantly, what doesn't, when you're looking death in the mouth.

Without getting into personal details, this book meant a great deal to me at a very difficult, and rather traumatic, time of my life. I found the honesty with which the Japanese confront death so refreshing—all pretension is stripped away, and one is left alone with the mystery of eternity. This book was genuinely a therapeutic read.

For some the constantly reiterated imagery, deeply-rooted in Japanese Buddhist philosophy, of moon and seasons and flowers, may become repetitive. For me, I think deep truths become more true the more they are repeated, not less. It is the genius of Japanese poetry in general that simplicity conceals profound meaning, meaning which unfolds itself in your mind as you meditate on it. This is not a book to be read in a hurry.

If I quoted all my favourite poems, since I'd end up quoting half the book. Here are just a few:

&gt;The year is ending:  
I have not left my heart behind.  
—Hankai  

&gt;Farewell—and though there be  
no budding in the spring,  
no autumn withering—all is well.  
—Hakusai  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Rise, let us go—  
along the path lies the clear dew.  
—Fujo  
&gt;  
&gt;  
In earth and sky  
no grain of dust—  
snow on the foothills.  
—Chirin  
&gt;  
&gt;  
A cuckoo cries the end—  
clouds on a summer morning.  
—Goshuku  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Though I tarry on the road my master took,  
above us glows one moon.  
—Isaibo  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Man's end,  
a mound of gleaming bones:  
a flowering and a fading.  
—Hamei  
&gt;  
&gt;  
My old body:  
a drop of dew  
grown heavy at the leaf-tip  
—Kiba  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Since I was born  
I must die,  
and so...  
—Kisei  
&gt;  
&gt;  
If I must die  
let it be autumn  
ere the dew is dry.  
—Koyo

If you are at all interested in death, poetry or Japanese culture, buy this book. By all means skip the introduction if you want to get straight to the poems, but just read it. You won't regret it. And maybe, if you take to heart the philosophy of these profoundly wise men, you will be able to face the equally terrifying, equally strange phenomena of death and life without regret, as well.

&gt;To learn how to die,  
watch cherry blossoms,  
observe chrysanthemums

&gt;Tonight, Evelyn Hardcastle will be killed... again.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;It is meant to be a celebration but it ends in tragedy. As fireworks explode overhead, Evelyn Hardcastle, the young and beautiful daughter of the house, is killed.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;But Evelyn will not die just once. Until Aiden – one of the guests summoned to Blackheath for the party – can solve her murder, the day will repeat itself, over and over again. Every time ending with the fateful pistol shot.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;The only way to break this cycle is to identify the killer. But each time the day begins again, Aiden wakes in the body of a different guest. And someone is determined to prevent him ever escaping Blackheath... 

 

This month we will be reading *The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle* by Stuart Turton. 

The dates of and links to the discussion threads can be found in the sticky comment on this post. You are welcome to read at your own pace. Don't worry about joining later on in the month. Usually it is pretty easy to catch up, but you are always welcome to join the discussions a little later.

Stuart Turton will be joining us for an AMA on **Friday, June 28.**

 **The Rules**

 * Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.

 * All suggestions made in this thread must be direct replies to other people's requests. Do not post suggestions in reply to this self-post.

 * All unrelated comments will be deleted in the interest of cleanliness.

 **How to get the best recommendations**

 The most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.

 ____

 All Weekly Recommendation Threads are linked below the header throughout the week to guarantee that this thread remains active day-to-day.  For those bursting with books that you are hungry to suggest, the suggested sort is new; you may need to do this manually if your app or settings means this does not happen for you.

 If this thread has not slaked your desire for tasty book suggestions, we propose that you head on over to the aptly named subreddit /r/suggestmeabook.

Really? But by far the worst part of it to me is the protagonist. He's such a gargantuan Mary Sue. And I know that's an overused term, but this is textbook. His life story is based on the author's. He's great at everything and just picks up like 3 languages over the course of the book. He's *so* good at fighting but he's also such a good guy that he never kills anybody. Literally every character loves him. They're practically falling over themselves to tell him what a great guy he is. He's chosen by the mysterious spiritual gangster character. He's part of the mafia so you know he's super tough and dangerous, but he's also such a great guy he's always a little bit set apart because he's not like those BAD mafia guys. Women want him and men want to be him. He's brave, tough, smart, dangerous, kind. Relax dude, an actual flaw wouldn't hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

And I won't even get to into the pseudo-philosophical faff that fills it. Long pages of discussion, aka the author shoving his half baked ideas that don't really make any sense down your throat.

Hi, I don't want to exclude anyone from commenting, but since I'd especially like to hear from guys, I'm going to address my message to them. I will appreciate comments from anyone!

I'm a woman, and I love a good love story. But guys, don't you like love, too? You fall in love in real life. Do you not want to read love stories, and if so, why not? Do you feel like love stories aren't published (by this I mean written and marketed) with you in mind? Maybe you do like to read love stories, and I'm just ignorant. To me, it seems that love stories are published based on the idea that love is for women and the LGBTQ community. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with that. I'm happy we have love stories, and people love to read them. I'm just curious why we have this idea that guys don't want or like to read them. Is it true?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;REVISED TITLE: Do guys read love stories?&lt;/h1&gt;

*No life story with a happy ending to tell, only a contrivance of horror, then nothingness—and nothing else.*

*No free will-to-live, no redemption by a will-to-die, how depressing.*

*No philosophies to peddle, pessimism a no-sale, optimism had to close its doors, too wicked to pass code.*

*No mechanisms or mind-games, repressional mechanisms broke down, self-deception shuttered its windows.*

*No awakening from a dream within a dream, mutation of consciousness—parent of all horrors, best not mess with it, extinction looking better all the time.*

*No more pleasure, what there was of it, a few crumbs left by chaos at feast, still a good supply of pain though.*

*No praiseworthy incentives, just bowel-movement pressures, potato-mashing relativism.*

*No euthanasia, bad of the business of life, you're on your own here, but watch out for the eternal return, most horrible idea in the universe.*

*No loving God, omnipotence off duty and omniscience on leave, the deity: He, dead—the horror, the horror, even the skies of spring and the flowers of summer must ever afterward be poison, blame it on the piecing together of dissociated knowledge.*

*No compassionate Buddha, body snatchers got him, heard tell, or some kind of thing, maybe next lifetime.*

*No Good-versus-Evil formulas around here, Azathoth running the show, human beings a mistake or joke, something pernicious making a nightmare of our world.*

*No being normal and real, the uncanny coming at you full speed, startling and dreadful.*

*No ego-death—enlightenment by accident.*

*No way out of harm's way, better never to have been, worst saved for last.*

*No Last Messiah, buried in the fingernails of midwives and pacifier makers, gone the way of messiahs past.*

It would please me if you take the money and use it for some kindly purpose. Buy meals for poor children or donate copies of the magazine to those who cannot afford to buy them or whatever your good heart tells you to do.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, however, do not take this as a precedent for other American writers. Some American writers do travel and might   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;intend to visit Poland and might be able to use such money very well. And may the time come when all nations will be friends and all peoples will be one.&lt;/p&gt;

+ Trust (kind of similar to my first point) in certain bookstores about their selection.

+ Have uniqueness. For instance, a store in New Orleans were selling cuisine related books which I absolutely loved. Speaking with the owners personally taught me different perspectives about different subjects (e.g. cooking)

+ B&amp;N offers a wider range of international options especially in magazines. For instance, I was able to find physical copies of UK based magazines (You can technically find Kindle versions but reading in paper is different)

- Pricier but you receive it immediately (not a huge problem if you have Amazon Prime)

- Wider the bookstore/ franchise it feels more bland.

Online shopping
+ Cheap (unless you are paying for Prime)

+ Easy to read (especially with Kindle books)

While I do agree that this does not give you any idea what the book is about, I think it does a better job at telling you whether you will enjoy the book or not, which is why I want to defend it. I know the creator of the original post said that mainly nonficion books have this issue, but it is still present in fiction, and as I do not have any nonfiction books with this issue present at the moment, I do have examples from fiction books.  

When I picked up *The First Law* trilogy by Joe Abercrombie, the first thing to greet me was praise from George R. R. Martin saying ""Joe Abercrombie is doing some terrific work."" Similarly, when I picked up *The Cold Commands* by Richard Morgan, I saw a quote comparing Morgan to Abercrombie, and then a quote from Abercrombie himself endorsing Morgan. Even though both *The Blade Itself* and *The Cold Commands* have synopses, I didn't have more than a single glance at either before reading the books. I enjoyed both, and entered them without knowing anything about either except that they most likely right up my alley since they are endorsed by authors whom I trust. Authors I've read and at least somewhat enjoyed, whose words I respect. It was the was the same when I picked up *The Wise Man's Fear* by Patrick Rothfuss and saw a genuine review from Brandon Sanderson, as well when I picked up *Nevernight* by Jay Kristoff which (on my edition) has personal praise from Rothfuss. I haven't finished either of those two, but I have enjoyed them immensely thus far. And again, I believe that they're telling the truth, simply because it seems like they've actually read the book, and wanted to write a review about it.

There are also examples of books I've bought for the synopses and now that I've read them, I wish I'd read their praise first. The easiest examples to bring up are Sarah J. Maas' *Throne of Glass* and its prequel, *The* *Assassin's Blade*. The premise of an assassin that has lost everything and is given another shot at life but has to fight for it sounds amazing! And without turning this post into a criticism of the *Throne of Glass* series, I'll condense it into one sentence: what I found most enjoyable was criticizing it. The prequels were even worse as its synopsis is simply wrong, but that is something I found out while reading the thing. However, another thing I noticed while reading the prequels is that it has a page for praise, and none of them are really saying what is good about the series except for ""the plot is riddled"" and ""enthralling, thrilling and beautiful."" These sentences aren't really specific for *Throne of Glass* and could be copy-pasted onto another book without anyone really noticing. While on the other hand, what Sanderson says about *Wise Man's Fear* are precise ideas that couldn't and wouldn't be plastered to just any book.

One last example is actually my personally favourite book: *The Silmarillion* by John R. R. Tolkien. My copy has a synopsis that could simply be a random praise, but a praise that is printed right below the synopsis, is from The Guardian and asks ""How, given little over half a century, did one man become the creative equivalent of a people?"" That quote alone is the majority of the concept of what I recommend about Tolkien when I get the chance to recommend his work. How beautifully it's written, and how wonderfully rich his world is. I don't recommend *The Silmarillion* because it's the ""legendary precursor to The Lord of the Rings"" like the synopsis says.

So where am I headed with all this? Well, to give a short conclusion: praise may not always tell you what the book is about, but with experience it can tell you whether it's a book you'll like. Of course, there are exceptions: some books you'll like and some books you won't, regardless of synopsis or praise. But even so, how I treat it is if the book only has the simple ""breathtaking,"" then unless that's from a source I can trust or respect, then there really isn't anything to give praise to and I might as well just continue on my list instead.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently saw &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/c0juw9/an_irritating_publishing_trend/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x""&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; (titled: &lt;em&gt;An irritating publishing trend&lt;/em&gt;) bringing attention to the topic regarding publishers not printing a synopsis on the back of books, instead printing reviews that may simply say &amp;quot;breathtaking.&amp;quot; While I do agree that this does not give you any idea what the book is about, I think it does a better job at telling you whether you will enjoy the book or not, which is why I want to defend it.

2. I hate Ana. I don’t care how insensitive I sound and hopeful people will agree with me. She’s a wasted character and I find her annoying.

Ready Player One book and movie are essentially two completely different stories set in the same universe, with many different references to the 80s. Likely, when they made the movie they had to change a few things up, because even though the book is from 2011, some things were already outdated (e.g. in the book they still write blogs, while in the movie players are on twitch). Also I find that the movie references more well-known geek artifacts, as opposed to the book that focuses a lot on old arcade games that many younger people probably never heard of (among many, many other 80s references).

In sum, the two are vastly different experiences, so it is definitely worth to check out both. I actually find it hard to compare the versions entirely, because of how different they are. Only one things that really bugged me in the movie version: The bad guys are more of a joke you're supposed to laugh at, while in the novel, they are actually a scary vision of a corporate-controlled future, in which capital surpasses the value of a human life (if we haven't already reached that future!). On the other hand, though, I really loved the actor they chose for Halliday. He has the perfect voice for both an awkward real-life geek guy, and the wizard avatar Anorak. I felt like it greatly enriched my imagination of that character when I read the book (first watched the film, then read the book, then watched film again).

Anyway, what's you guys' opinion on the book and movie, or about reading a book that has a film adaptation?

Edit: You can have whichever opinion you like on it, you're free to hate it :) but downvoting for not sharing your opinion on a book is a bit weird (in reference to the comments, not to this post)

Edit 2: Thanks for the interesting discussion. It seems like RP1 is a book you either deeply hate or love. I agree it is not an extraordinary piece of literature, it reads more like YA fiction (though I doubt that's the audience).

But i decided to give the first few chapters a read anyway, and good heavens, it is marvelous.

Reading through all the written etiquette makes you wonder where it all went, in just 100 years, it has all but vanished, the carefully laid rules of ones life, not heeded anymore.

Throughout it gives you etiquette and rules of politeness thou must follow, even little things, like giving your lady the right-hand seat on your carriage, something that does not exactly apply to today's motorcars, but it will make you think the next time a lady will be traveling in your vehicle, shall you or not, give the lady the right-hand seat? 

Chapter after chapter you will feel that you have been writing the wrong way, talking to people the wrong way, greeting wrong, and doing nearly everything wrong.

It not as so brainwashes you on how to live, but rather the messages conveyed go deep into your mind, into your heart, where they will forever be respected, you will want to bow down to all your friends, be helpful to ladies and fellow gentlemen, you will not want to brag about your new luxury car, not after you read this book anyway.

It will also make you think of the rudeness and impoliteness around you, all the things in the book that it claims to be ""indicative of ill-breeding"" can be found in everyday life, out in public, at the diner, everywhere, and certainly most of the written etiquette that does not apply today can be skipped, but not all of it, most of it still applies and is very important to modern living, and it certainly is sad to think that knowledge and use of these written rules is waning, some may disagree, and while gentlemen are often laughed at, it certainly is a perfect time to be a gentlemen, and you can do it all for free, in this one book.


It also explains some examples of etiquette gone wrong

&gt; In countries where royalty rules the etiquette, it often happens that pride will blind those who make the rules, and the results are often fatal. Believing that the same deference which their rank authorized them to demand, was also due to them as individuals, the result of such an idea was an etiquette as vain and useless as it was absurd.

&gt; For an example I will give an anecdote:

&gt; “The kings of Spain, the proudest and vainest of all{35} kings of the earth, made a rule of etiquette as stupid as it was useless. It was a fault punishable by death to touch the foot of the queen, and the individual who thus offended, no matter under what circumstances, was executed immediately.

&gt; “A young queen of Spain, wife of Charles the Second, was riding on horseback in the midst of her attendants. Suddenly the horse reared and threw the queen from the saddle. Her foot remained in the stirrup, and she was dragged along the ground. An immense crowd stood looking at this spectacle, but no one dared, for his life, to attempt to rescue the poor woman. She would have died, had not two young French officers, ignorant of the stupid law which paralyzed the Spaniards, sprung forward and saved her. One stopped the horse, and whilst he held the bridle, his companion disengaged from its painful position the foot of the young queen, who was, by this time, insensible from fear and the bruises which she had already received. They were instantly arrested, and while the queen was carried on a litter to the palace, her young champions were marched off, accompanied by a strong guard, to prison. The next day, sick and feeble, the queen was obliged to leave her bed, and on her knees before the king, plead for the pardon of the two Frenchmen; and her prayer was only granted upon condition that the audacious foreigners left Spain immediately.”

&gt; There is no country in the world where the absurdities of etiquette are carried to so great a length as in Spain, because there is no nation where the nobility are so{36} proud. The following anecdote, which illustrates this, would seem incredible were it not a historical fact:

&gt; “Philip the Third, king of Spain, was sick, and being able to sit up, was carefully placed in an arm chair which stood opposite to a large fire, when the wood was piled up to an enormous height. The heat soon became intolerable, and the courtiers retired from around the king; but, as the Duke D’Ussede, the fire stirrer for the king, was not present, and as no one else had the right to touch the fire, those present dared not attempt to diminish the heat. The grand chamberlain was also absent, and he alone was authorized to touch the king’s footstool. The poor king, too ill to rise, in vain implored those around him to move his chair, no one dared touch it, and when the grand chamberlain arrived, the king had fainted with the heat, and a few days later he died, literally roasted to death.”

So, I'll admit, this post will be just kind of a vent, but I also want to hear if anyone else has experienced something similar. During my freshmen year of college I spent many hours reading, annotating, and just really digging into a copy of ""IT"" that I'd bought the summer before. It was the first book I've really read non-stop, I mean, for hours on end and hundreds of pages on end. Considering the themes of the book, it was a really neat read as I was right on the crux between being a teenager and an adult. I really got a lot from the book and it was a great experience to read it. I annotate all the books I read because I want to be able to go back and experience them again, what I found in them at that point in my life, how it felt to read them for the first time. Unfortunately, I've been looking for my copy of IT recently and just can't find it. I'm beginning to think I may have left it back in my dorm room at the end of my freshman year - I was so sleep-deprived and exhausted that I ended up leaving an entire painting print (that had great sentimental value, mind you - thankfully I was able to recover that) on the wall when I left, so it certainly isn't out of the realm of possibility. Chances are it's lying around somewhere, but I just will be bummed out if it's not. I'm a pretty sentimental person and I tend to attach feeling to pretty much any old object, and it's probably a vice I should learn to temper, but eh. 

Anyways, this whole thing has got me thinking about why people annotate their books and the attachments people form with them. Why do you annotate your books, or, if you don't, why not? Do you prefer to find old copies with other people's annotations (I like to do this too...)? Do you find that annotating distracts you from the experience of reading or enhances it?

Burroughs is a complex novella that explores a man so far outside of society that he wanders through it as though separated by common decency by a screen. This book is semi-autobiographical and follows Lee (Burroughs) as he floats around Mexico and South America in search of sexual conquests and feeding his addictions while suffering heroin withdrawal.

While book may seem tame by modern standards, there are no graphic depictions of sex, the mere fact that this novel openly talks about homosexual relationships made it quite controversial for the 1950s (although not published until the mid 80s). Throughout the novel Burroughs uses many slurs and derogatory descriptions of homosexuals and mexicans. This is not only a sign of the times and attitudes in which the book was written but also the authors complicated feelings of sadness and self loathing.

Queer is more simple than some of Burroughs later work but there are definitely some hints to the strangeness and haunting writing that was ahead of him.

While it is easy to project judgement on Burroughs and his fictional alter ego Lee I think it is missing the point as he has no intention of making his life or any of the stories contained in Queer to be palatable or moral. He isn't seeking out approval, he is documenting his reality. 

I have read Queer many times and this time it really struck me how sadness permiates the work. The surface interpreation of Lee as a predator, and degenerate drug addict is valid but I also really appreciated the underlying sadness, and self hatred that seem to be at Lee's core. This of course to notr absolve or forgive him but it gives me a greater understanding. Lee's seeking of sex is a mask and a cheap way to try and find human connection. As an outsider, he cannot get people to relate to him easily so he turns to sex when he is looking for human companionship


&gt;He put one arm across Allerton's chest and snuggled close to the boy's body. A feeling of deep tenderness flowed out from Lee's body at the warm contact. He snuggled closer and stroked Allerton's shoulder gently. Allerton moved irritably, pushing Lee's arm away.
""Slack off will you, and go to sleep,"" said Allerton. He turned on his side, with his back to Lee. Lee drew his arm back. His whole body contracted with shock. Slowly he put his hand under his cheek. He felt a deep hurt, as though he were bleeding inside. Tears ran down his face.

It was really dark when you look back. Though as a kid i just cared about the progression, you really appreciate how dark it was once you look back on it.

&amp;#x200B;

The series had an interesting enough premise. The book was about kids who could use morphing technology to change into different animals to fight off an alien invasion of slug-like aliens. These slugs were waging a silent invasion on earth in order to capture hosts and take over their brains/bodies. They could be inside anyone, even your mom and dad, who are trapped in their own brain as the Yerk inside them plotted on you next.

&amp;#x200B;

(SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT)

&amp;#x200B;

First... The book was violent and graphic from the start. It featured and was aimed at 13 year olds. Very graphic stories of bodies being torn limb from limb, feeling yourself dying, blood gushing from what was left of your torn body as you slip awayyyy

&amp;#x200B;

But it was so much more then that.  It showed you what can happen in war.

&amp;#x200B;

The kids started off not wanting to be the monsters. They said they wanted to fight them, not become them. But oh, how war can change even a child.  They were 13 when the war started, 16 when it ended.

&amp;#x200B;

At first, they did not want to kill at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Then... They limited it to not killing humans.

&amp;#x200B;

Then it was.  ""We don't kill humans who are running away.""

&amp;#x200B;

Then it was ""We don't kill prisoners""

&amp;#x200B;

Then it was ""We kill all enemies on sight""

&amp;#x200B;

That turned into ""We kill anyone who slows us down, we don't care who they are""

&amp;#x200B;

Then it was ""We do kill prisoners.  In fact, we will black mail you about it"".

&amp;#x200B;

Next. Threats of Mass murder and destruction. Innocents included. Anything or anyone near the target.

&amp;#x200B;

Next. Mass murder and destruction. Innocents included. Anything or anyone near the target.

&amp;#x200B;

Next. Mass murder of helpless prisoners as a distraction. Or.. just because the Animorph leader was having a bad day.

&amp;#x200B;

Next? Send your closest family member to kill your other closest family member. As a distraction. (They both die.)

&amp;#x200B;

Next?  Tell yourself about how you are the good guy, so you would never turn into another human using your morphing powers without their permission.

&amp;#x200B;

Next?  Steal some hospitalized guy's blood from his body so you can use your morphing power to turn into a human without his permission.

&amp;#x200B;

Next?  Woo handicapped children to fight for your guerrilla army. By promising them the power to get out of, and maybe even heal their handicapped bodies, using the morphing process.

&amp;#x200B;

Next? Order the handicapped children to kill a bunch of giant worms. Make the children de-morph exposed in open combat, and flop around helpless in their natural handicapped bodies, in order to turn into dangerous animals to kill almost helpless giant worms who were sentient and mostly slaves themselves, and to themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

Next?  Order the handicapped children to commit suicide via being incinerated one by one. By attacking a powerful flying spaceship as tigers and bears. As a distraction.  (Berate them and peer pressure them when they get scared)

&amp;#x200B;

And lets not forget... Force a ""dog-life-force-giving"" android pacifist with incredible strength and technological ability to assist in killing by threatening to kill as many prisoners as it took. As a distraction.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh... And have most of the main cast most likely die in a suicide attack at the end of the book. Cliff-Hanger.

&amp;#x200B;

(From commentators who refreshed my memory.)

&amp;#x200B;

Also: Convinced a kid to join them as an ally in the war. Trapped him for life as a rat when he could not handle it. Made him beg to die.

&amp;#x200B;

Also: Make allies with a friendly pre-historic earth based alien race. Trick them. Make them go extinct. And take their weapon to save themselves instead.

&amp;#x200B;

Also: Made a kind-hearted pacifist android fall into deep depression by forcing him to live an eternity with the memories of tearing living creatures apart.

....

&amp;#x200B;

Ya...

&amp;#x200B;

The book also discussed numerous social controversies, romance during war, and was a clever read, and made me laugh more then any other book with its humor. It was a heck of a book series.

&amp;#x200B;

Wanted to get to state this book series may have a bit of a ""childish"" writing ideology at the surface, but is a good read, and has great progression of its story and characters. It has a very detailed world. I recommend it.

&lt;p&gt;Also: Make allies with a friendly pre-historic earth based alien race. Trick them. Make them go extinct. And take their weapon to save themselves instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also: Made a kind-hearted pacifist android fall into deep depression by forcing him to live an eternity with the memories of tearing living creatures apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ya...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book also discussed numerous social controversies, romance during war, and was a clever read, and made me laugh more then any other book with its humor. It was a heck of a book series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wanted to get to state this book series may have a bit of a &amp;quot;childish&amp;quot; writing ideology at the surface, but is a good read, and has great progression of its story and characters. It has a very detailed world. I recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shout out to anyone who remembers the Visser Chronicles. Nobody has mentioned it out of all the comments here yet!&lt;/p&gt;

During this time Weir actually wrote his first novel, *Theft of Pride*, which he only published on the internet as far as I can tell.

After Casey &amp; Andy ended Weir went on to do a fantasy webcomic project titled *Cheshire Crossing* about the further adventures of Dorothy Gale, Wendy Darling, and Alice Liddel. It's basically X-men for Victorian children's fantasy and I personally consider it very well written, but unfortunately the art was still extremely mediocre and the comic didn't get very much attention.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm starting a buddy reading group for YA Fantasy Books and I'm looking for members! This group is meant to encourage people to keep reading and have discussions every so often about the books.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm starting with the Throne of Glass series - a popular series by Sarah J. Maas.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a bit about the first book (from Goodreads):

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After serving out a year of hard labor in the salt mines of Endovier for her crimes, 18-year-old assassin Celaena Sardothien is dragged before the Crown Prince. Prince Dorian offers her her freedom on one condition: she must act as his champion in a competition to find a new royal assassin.  


Her opponents are men-thieves and assassins and warriors from across the empire, each sponsored by a member of the king's council. If she beats her opponents in a series of eliminations, she'll serve the kingdom for four years and then be granted her freedom. Celaena finds her training sessions with the captain of the guard, Westfall, challenging and exhilarating. But she's bored stiff by court life. Things get a little more interesting when the prince starts to show interest in her ... but it's the gruff Captain Westfall who seems to understand her best.  


Then one of the other contestants turns up dead ... quickly followed by another. Can Celaena figure out who the killer is before she becomes a victim? As the young assassin investigates, her search leads her to discover a greater destiny than she could possibly have imagined.

This post is going to be spoiler heavy so if you haven’t read East of Eden yet and you still want to, stop reading now.

This is going to be one big rant but I don’t know any other people irl who have read the book, and I had to air my frustrations somewhere, so I hope you will not find me too insufferable here.

A few years ago I’ve read East of Eden and I was blown away. I fell in love with the characters. I felt that the themes were extremely obvious but somehow it felt beautifully done. The book is so interspersed with these magnificent nuggets of wisdom and reflections on the human condition that I actually felt like I knew a little more about life after having read it.

A few weeks ago I’ve read it again and I’ve been feeling frustrated with it. The reason for it is that as I read it again something stood out to me and the book simply doesn’t seem to realize this, and in fact, almost pretends the opposite of this is the case. So here is my frustration:

Adam Trask is a pitiful loser without any redeeming qualities. There, I’ve said it. Let’s go over some key points in his life story.

He is raised by Cyrus, who blatantly favors him over his brother Charles. This culminates in an episode where a teenage Charles attempts to murder him, after which his father sends him off to join the military. Granted, that’s pretty traumatic and not something he so far could do a whole lot about. 

When he is in the military he ends up exchanging letters with his brother and they end up warming up to each other. He tells his brother he is coming home. Halfway on his way home he decides to reverse his decision and rejoins the military. He never informs his brother until years later, and only contacts him again when he needs Charles to help him out financially. (Hi, I didn’t bother writing to you for years even though you were expecting me to come home but can I borrow $100?)

When he finally returns home they find out their father died and the inheritance is enough to ensure they never have to work another day in their life. Adam consequently never does. 

Cathy comes washing up on their doorstep and Adam is immediately smitten. In the book this is often referred to as love, but it obviously is something different: infatuation. Adam is such a bad judge of character that he can’t see what everybody around him instantly notices: Cathy is the devil. 

Adam decides to move to California. Cathy says she doesn’t want to. He ignores her wishes and forces her to move. He buys a mansion with a large plot of land. Cathy doesn’t want to live there, but he decides that she’ll warm up to it. She never does. After Cathy delivers Charles’ twin baby boys she wants to leave. She is literally forced to shoot him before he lets her go.

For someone who truly loves another, he cares remarkably little about her wishes or even the things she literally tells him.

Adam sinks into a depression and withdraws into a dark hole. He didn’t name his twins for over an entire year, and then only did it because Sam beats the shit out of him. He neglects to care *about* them for 10 more, and even after that, he never *takes care of them* period. After 10 years he suddenly pretends to be their parent. We see this through his conversations with Lee, and he is surprised that they actually have characters of their own. He never actually starts to care about their inner life though. 

Adam gets over his depression by confronting Cathy. In their confrontation he somehow gets the upper hand by telling her that she is missing something. She doesn’t understand love, and he does. Except Adam is utterly incapable of loving anybody. After this confrontation Adam supposed he is cured(*yeah I was depressed for 10 years but I’m certain that after one talk everything will be fine from now*) and he tries to send Lee away as soon as he gets home. Thankfully, Lee declines, because without him everybody would be dead within a week.

Adam has no conception of money or work. He inherits a shit ton of money and lives off of that for the rest of his life. At one point he decides to gamble most of it away on a stupid project that everybody tells him is going to fail. Turns out, it fails, and he requires Lee to tally up the bills to see if he was even able to afford it in the first place.

I find it utterly unbelievable that Aaron and Cal would care about what this weak, absent minded, completely helpless and utterly self absorbed man would think about them. But they do.

In his relationship with his sons he shows blatant favoritism toward Aron. As does everybody except for Lee. Just like as in his relationship with Cathy he completely oblivious to who Aron is. He doesn’t care. In his world Aron is everything that’s good and everything that’s good is Aron. Evidence to the contrary be damned. 

All his imagination about what is bad he projects into his relationship with Cal. In fact the only moment he sort-of connects to Cal is when that idea is confirmed when he has to pick Cal up from the police station. When Cal tries to gain his appreciation by doing what Adam is incapable of, making money, doing something useful, he admonished him and accuses him of stealing it. He basically tells Cal he is an asshole for making money during a war.

Alright, so by now we have a clear picture: Adam is a narcissistic asshole who confuses his obsessions with his imagination of certain people with knowing, caring about and loving those people. He is incapable of doing anything useful, both for himself and others and the one thing in life he actually does fails miserably. 

This is where I get annoyed. Lee is a wise man, understanding, capable. He grasps psychology. He is capable of love. But then Lee reflects upon Adam as follows when talking to Cal:

&gt; I think in him kindness and conscience are so large that they are almost faults.

I’m sorry, what? There must be a hell of a lot happening off screen because there is nothing in the book that would warrant such a statement.
 
He goes on to say:

&gt; He’s not smart in a worldly sense but he’s a good man. Maybe the best man I have ever known.

I’m sorry Lee but you have lost your fucking mind?

It's pretty frequently discussed in science fiction circles as it extends into a far greater and wider universe, and even won both a Hugo and a Nebula. 

So I can't help but wonder why this book is so painfully difficult to read.

I don't want to get into a synopsis or finer details of everything that bothered me about it, because that might take more time to type than I have, so I'll keep it more brief. 

Louis Wu, the story's protagonist. 200 years old, but with the health and body of a 30 year-old man. Interesting enough, but what does Niven do with it? Nothing at all, besides use it in a few specific scenarios where he out-wisdoms someone younger and less inexperienced, or comes to ludicrous conclusions through insane jumps of logic that are *ALWAYS* correct. He is sexuality incarnate, and even humanoids of other races find him completely and utterly fuckable, and he finds no moral repercussions in doing just that. I have no qualms with flawed characters, but Louis never changes, and it's never written as though the things Louis does are *bad*, or wrong in any way. He's written to be flawless, and it seems to me like he's Niven's fantasy insert; the man all nerds WISH they could be, sleeping their way through the universe. 

I literally won't even get started on the female characters. And I think the argument ""he's from another time, you have to excuse some of it,"" is complete bullshit. It was the 70's, not the 1800s. Women, even 50 years ago, were viewed as people and not just fleshlights that speak. 

The aliens were so, close to being what Ringworld needed. They don't quite follow Louis's odd trains of thought, and find his practices unusual and often irritating. They're strange and genuinely inhuman, and it's desperately needed to breathe life into the book. Unfortunately, within 50 pages you have already found everything they have to offer. They are flat and static, and immediately become caricatures of themselves. Nessus is calculating and cowardly, and speaker is fierce and proud - but he likes to be scratched behind the ears, and purrs like a cat! How cute, right? 

And my last point: his prose in general. 

Larry Niven somehow managed to consistently make me feel like I was a stupid guy and a bad reader, in two distinct ways.

1. By describing things in ways that were impossible to picture, putting emphasis in strange places, and making unusual features seem mundane. 

2. Describing simple concepts at length like I was reading at a 6th grade level. Repeating things that never needed to be, or hiding inappropriate language, or spelling out every ""revelation"" of the story. 

But the reason all this grated so hard on me is that behind all of this hid a really interesting world, and story that I was truly drawn to. The Ringworld itself holds so much potential, and diving into ideas of determinism clicks on such a deep level. I'm not pissed that I read it, I'm pissed that it could have easily been so much better. 

Through reading this book, I came to the conclusion that it could have been so, so good if Niven had just given the outline to a better writer. 

Anyways, thoughts, opinions? Would love to hear from you guys!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago I read through Ringworld, as I&amp;#39;m a huge fan of science fiction and had been told it&amp;#39;s one of the greats; a classic.

&lt;p&gt;So I can&amp;#39;t help but wonder why this book is so painfully difficult to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to get into a synopsis or finer details of everything that bothered me about it, because that might take more time to type than I have, so I&amp;#39;ll keep it more brief. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Louis Wu, the story&amp;#39;s protagonist. 200 years old, but with the health and body of a 30 year-old man. Interesting enough, but what does Niven do with it? Nothing at all, besides use it in a few specific scenarios where he out-wisdoms someone younger and less inexperienced, or comes to ludicrous conclusions through insane jumps of logic that are &lt;em&gt;ALWAYS&lt;/em&gt; correct. He is sexuality incarnate, and even humanoids of other races find him completely and utterly fuckable, and he finds no moral repercussions in doing just that. I have no qualms with flawed characters, but Louis never changes, and it&amp;#39;s never written as though the things Louis does are &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, or wrong in any way. He&amp;#39;s written to be flawless, and it seems to me like he&amp;#39;s Niven&amp;#39;s fantasy insert; the man all nerds WISH they could be, sleeping their way through the universe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I literally won&amp;#39;t even get started on the female characters. And I think the argument &amp;quot;he&amp;#39;s from another time, you have to excuse some of it,&amp;quot; is complete bullshit. It was the 70&amp;#39;s, not the 1800s. Women, even 50 years ago, were viewed as people and not just fleshlights that speak. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aliens were so, close to being what Ringworld needed. They don&amp;#39;t quite follow Louis&amp;#39;s odd trains of thought, and find his practices unusual and often irritating. They&amp;#39;re strange and genuinely inhuman, and it&amp;#39;s desperately needed to breathe life into the book. Unfortunately, within 50 pages you have already found everything they have to offer. They are flat and static, and immediately become caricatures of themselves. Nessus is calculating and cowardly, and speaker is fierce and proud - but he likes to be scratched behind the ears, and purrs like a cat! How cute, right? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my last point: his prose in general. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Larry Niven somehow managed to consistently make me feel like I was a stupid guy and a bad reader, in two distinct ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;By describing things in ways that were impossible to picture, putting emphasis in strange places, and making unusual features seem mundane. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Describing simple concepts at length like I was reading at a 6th grade level. Repeating things that never needed to be, or hiding inappropriate language, or spelling out every &amp;quot;revelation&amp;quot; of the story. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the reason all this grated so hard on me is that behind all of this hid a really interesting world, and story that I was truly drawn to. The Ringworld itself holds so much potential, and diving into ideas of determinism clicks on such a deep level. I&amp;#39;m not pissed that I read it, I&amp;#39;m pissed that it could have easily been so much better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through reading this book, I came to the conclusion that it could have been so, so good if Niven had just given the outline to a better writer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, thoughts, opinions? Would love to hear from you guys!&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I like books about philosophy and I also like self-books. This new book by Edith Hall, a classics professor at King’s College London, looked promising – sitting at the nexus between philosophy and self-help, using Aristotle’s teachings from 2,500 years ago to “change your life” today. To be honest, I had a lot of trouble getting into it – even though I should have been the book’s target audience. 

I think the biggest reason is that the book was too much about Aristotle and not about how to apply Aristotle’s teachings to contemporary problems. Every now and then, the author will throw in a “I can relate to this because I have a problem with vengeance” or a “I have a friend who’s husband could use this advice,” but it’s all very superficial, and not very in-depth. I do agree 100% with the author that we – as individuals, and as a society – could benefit a lot from Aristotelian logic and ethics. But I already knew that going into the book. So, maybe in that sense, I wasn’t a very good candidate for reading this book – because I already agreed with the premise and didn’t really take anything from it. About the midway point, I figured my time was better spent elsewhere and I returned it to my library. 

I still think this could be a fine book for a very specific audience (maybe people who don’t know a lot about Aristotle and would like to learn more), but that’s admittedly not many people.  Other than that, I’m not really sure anyone else would benefit from it.

To help kick off the discussion:

* Who do you think broke into Lady Hardcastle's Room? Why did they take the guns and the page from the day planner? 

* Should Aidan trust Anna as much as he does? Should he trust his own feelings towards her?

* Why do you think Aidan volunteered to come to Blackheath? Do you think he was fully aware of what he was getting into?

* What do you think Stanwin has on Evelyn?

* What do you consider the most suspicious event so far, but you suspect it has nothing to do with solving the mystery?

* Why do you think Evelyn's unsolved murder deserves such an elaborate manner of solution?

Feel free to answer any or all of the questions or tell us what you think of the book so far.
