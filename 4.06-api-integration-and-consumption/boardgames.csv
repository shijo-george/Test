**Original Post**

I've been to my fair share of cons, but last weekend was my first time seeing them from the other side of the bar. I had a blast, met some awesome people and got my ass kicked at Star Realms. It was a truly awesome experience.

However, I was honestly shocked at the way some people spoke to my fellow demonstrators and wanted to bring this up here and perhaps clear up a few things.

First off, here is an actual interaction I had with an attendee.

It was the busiest day of the convention and our game had already booked up all of its demo slots by mid-morning. Unfortunately, that meant I had to disappoint a lot of people, most of whom were really cool about it and many of whom remarked on how awesome it was that we were so popular. It was at this point that an American Lady approached us.

Me = Me / AL = American Lady

AL: ""Hi, I'd like to book a slot for your game""

Me: ""I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid we're fully booked up for the whole day, but...""

AL: ""Can I book one for tomorrow then?""

Me: ""Once again, really sorry, but we're only taking on-the-day bookings to give single day ticket holders a fair chance at getting a game. If you come back early tomorrow, I can book you in.""

AL: ""So I'm not special enough to book for tomorrow then?""

Me: ""Nobody is. The only fair way to go about this is to treat everybody equally, but if you...""

AL: ""I see how it is"" *proceeds to storm away in a tantrum*

I wish this was an isolated incident, but it was by no means the only time I saw this kind of interaction.

I realise most of you already know this and I'm effectively preaching to the choir, but the demo guys at conventions are almost all volunteers, giving up their whole weekend to add a little bit of variety to your con. You don't need to thank them, after all, they want to be there, but at least be nice to them.

This kind of behaviour is not cool when visited upon actual paid employees, but it's really quite indefensible to speak to a volunteer like that. I'd hate to think that some bright-eyed, young, first-time demonstrator might be put off of ever volunteering again because some mean attendee made them feel like crap.

I get it. It's humid, stuffy, noisy in the hall. You've just had to re-mortgage your apartment to afford an overpriced cheeseburger and a cup of stale coffee, and now that game you really wanted to try out is denied you, despite you paying a fair bit of cash for a ticket to attend, but it isn't anyone's fault.

It certainly isn't the fault of the happy, smiling nerd who would have informed you that the whole team had volunteered to run games in a local bar all evening for those who were disappointed, had you only let him finish any of his sentences.

**Mistakes**

&amp;#x200B;

**Games we've released back into the wild:**

* Quoridor - Gorgeous &amp; Brilliant, but too chesslike. Abstract Strategy seems to collect dust)
* Santorini - Beautiful components, great mechanics, didn't know we HATE Abstract Strategy)
* Stratego: 50 Years - A childhood game I adored, but... Abstract Strategy. Are you seeing a pattern?)
* Ticket To Ride: New York - Not enough choices to make. Great for kids.
* Pandemic Legacy: Season 1 - Never played. Sat on the shelf for a whole year. All the hype in the world just couldn't make that game look interesting to us, I guess.
* Lost Cities - Too Simple. Felt like a waste of time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Games we'll be selling from our collection:**

* Age of War (2014) - Way too much luck! Made a home made expansion to make it more fun.
* Carcassonne (2000) - Great for it's time, like the Beatles.
* Eight-Minute Empire (2012) - Fantastic for what it is, but a little too ""travel-game"" for us.
* Flip Ships (2017) - We prefer Strategy to Dexterity, but still an Awesome Game!
* Game of Thrones: Hand of the King (2016) - Abstract Strategy. when will I learn?
* Jamaica (2007) - It's a wonderful family game, just not what we were looking for.
* NMBR 9 (2014) - Too simple for us.
* Rising 5: Runes of Asteros (2017) - Beautiful Dutrait Art, and cool mechanics, but low replay-ability.

**Realizations**

&amp;#x200B;

**Find what YOU Like/Dislike:** All the reviews in the world won't give you 100% a purchase success rate. You don't know what you like and don't like until you play it. Part of the learning curve of Board Gaming is making purchase mistakes and learning from them. I didn't even know what Abstract Strategy was, until one day I thought ""Hey, all these games I dislike are kind of chesslike..."" or that I seemed to love a certain amount of options, or that I seem to care about the component's art more than most, or that I love multiplayer solitaire with just a little ""take that"".

&amp;#x200B;

**Don't RELY on Reviews:** BGG and Reviewers might point you in the right direction, but ultimately, if you want to know if you will like a game, watch it being played, or play it yourself. Hearing an overview of it's mechanics aren't enough to know if you will find them satisfying.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pace yourself:** If you're anything like me, you want to buy way more than you can play. A lot of us are collectors by nature, and that can really hurt finances and even make you resent the hobby. I made a couple of rules to keep my collector-nature at bay and to motivate me to pay more. I realize that **these rules aren't for everyone**, but they are perfect for us.

In order to buy a new game:

1. **No Shelf of Shame:** Each game in your collection should have been played at least 1 time.
2. **10 Plays:** At least 10 plays of any games between each purchase.
3. **25 Max:** 25 Games Max in your collection. (If you want something new, sell something you aren't playing.)

&amp;#x200B;

Cheers!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Shelf: &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/JEBnXrz.jpg""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/JEBnXrz.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to take a moment to share our collection and ramblings, and thank you all for being part of a friendly and informative community that elevates this hobby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context: We are &lt;strong&gt;2 tired parents&lt;/strong&gt; that love to game at the end of the day. We keep our gaming relatively light and short. We love Eurogames, and dislike co-op and abstract.&lt;/p&gt;

Just the skull tokens are pictured. What would be the rose tokens are just plain blank chips. 

Skull is one of my absolute favorite games to break out at the bar with my gaming group and as a way to bring non-gamers into our circle.

One evening we met some friends at one of the local breweries, and needless to say one of the players refused to treat the components with respect, and had rubbed the ever-loving crap out of it, scuffing it up (as seen in the album). So, Skull sat on the shelf for a while so I could ignore the fact that it was damaged. Another friend had a copy that was ruined by small children, and so I decided that I wanted to make an inexpensive and more durable solution for us.

I ordered an inexpensive set of Cardinal poker chips from Amazon (\~$8), borrowed a container of Mod Podge from a friend and printed some skull icons on my printer. I cut out the icons using a small Xacto knife and then just put a couple layers of mod podge on the top to protect them. From that cheap set of poker chips I was able to make 6 sets of Skull tokens with 5 different colors. All-in-all, less than $10 worth of materials and 1 hour of my time.

Best part? They're damn-near indestructible. Not only are they rub-proof, but spill-proof and their small size makes it super easy to put in the car and take with me. If I lose a piece I just replace it easily with another chip. I'd highly recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive alternative!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Album here (graphic imagery of ruined game components, fair warning!):  &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/Kqo2Nwt""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/Kqo2Nwt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It's not like I'm special, but I just happen to be available and like heavy games. Anyway, I've noticed one particular player wins most of the time, so I've started watching him closely to see what he's doing to win. Well turns out I've caught him cheating in a few games to accomplish feats he normally wouldn't be able to. He does this with long AP, which is real, but it sometimes leads to him fiddling around with his player board until he suddenly has the resources to accomplish X task. He'll make and undo moves multiple times a game and it gets so frustrating that we become disengaged and I've seen him ""fidget shuffle"" pieces where they weren't. 

As an example, the other day in **Gaia Project** he didn't have enough resources to make a Research Lab, but after an 8 minute AP turn, not even joking, he suddenly had resources for it. Listen, I challenge any of you to really concentrate on what's going on over an 8 minute turn of someone thinking. Most can't because it's like watching paint dry. Anyway, he almost always beats us by like 40 points and I've seen him cheat at least 4 times in the 5 games I understood the game. Then tonight in **Brass: Lancashire** (Birmingham is better) I saw him take from the top of his discard after another guy made a move. He took this because it was a location to block the other player's next turn. A card even went flying and I noticed that he clearly swapped out in the chaos of him somehow dropping 2 cards? Fortunately he came in third this game.

Fact is I don't have proof other than my own experiences seeing him. I didn't want to fuck up the game night because I was having fun, but between his long AP turns and him cheating, I really don't want to play with him anymore. I don't want to call him out in front of everyone to get into an argument, I don't want things to get into a he/said he/said argument and I don't want things to get physical because I'm an adult and adults who fight are lame. 

I was thinking of messaging the two guys I really like to play games with and letting them know what I have seen and that I won't be playing until he isn't. I'm worried it'll cause me to be pushed out of the group though and shit is tough now and the group is keeping me distracted. What the hell do I do?

I know this doesn't sound like a problem in general, but was hoping the experienced and wise here could help me out. Basically, I formed a group with a partner (the main host) of a friend of a friend of my wife (it was hard to find gamers in my circle!). It was just 3 of us initially but since a lot of games that we wanted to try out had 4 players, the host added his friend to the group on our second meetup. We all got along and we had a blast so he became a fixture. Then the host added another dude who was also cool but he kinda likes playing one type of game. Anyway Im cool with that (well not really but cool enough because he gets into the games and really amps up the fun factor). So then he also became a fixture because it turns out him and the host were old childhood friends who have reconnected over these game sessions, which im happy for. 

Now for the upcoming sessions I just found out the host just invited another 2 of his friends to join. Now here's the part I find tricky: since im the one supplying 95% of the games we play, do I have any say in determining how big the group gets? The host is the one hosting all sessions because he lives most centrally and does not have a car (and they're all his friends). 

Am I being selfish for trying to keep the group sizes down just so we can play certain games? Perhaps I should be more altruistic and see the larger benefits of social bonding? I've voiced some concerns about the player count but the host brushed it off by saying he can sit it out and share hands but I don't think that would be ideal. Should I just put up and shut up or is there something I can do? Im not a confrontational person so telling the host directly I want him to stop inviting more people would be difficult. Minor point - apart from me, the rest of the group share a long history and I tend to feel left out when they start talking non-game things.

Anyway thanks so much for reading and I hope to hear your own experiences and advice.

Tldr; Am I wrong for wanting the host of our game nights to keep the group small (4-5 players) even though I bring most of the games?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi community!

God I forgot how cutthroat this game can get while being a very lighthearted game at the same time.

Once the city was taken care of, control over the farmland was next as it was pretty much one continuous farm that touched almost every completed city. Up until the last tile was placed it was up in the air over who would be crowned master farmer (the player who ended up with control over the farm got 24 points from 8 cities.) 

Not really sure why I stopped playing the game so long ago but I was certainly reminded of how much fun it can be to flip tiles and see if you can screw over your friends who are trying to take over your city.

**Description from Boardgamegeek**:

Description from the publisher:

After being stripped of all their possessions, a mage, a warrior, an elf, and a dwarf are forced to go rob the local Magic Maze shopping mall for all the equipment necessary for their next adventure. They agree to map out the labyrinth in its entirety first, then find each individual’s favorite store, and then locate the exit. In order to evade the surveillance of the guards who eyed their arrival suspiciously, all four will pull off their heists simultaneously, then dash to the exit. That's the plan anyway…but can they pull it off?

Magic Maze is a real-time, cooperative game. Each player can control any hero in order to make that hero perform a very specific action, to which the other players do not have access: Move north, explore a new area, ride an escalator… All this requires rigorous cooperation between the players in order to succeed at moving the heroes prudently. However, you are allowed to communicate only for short periods during the game; the rest of the time, you must play without giving any visual or audio cues to each other. If all of the heroes succeed in leaving the shopping mall in the limited time allotted for the game, each having stolen a very specific item, then everyone wins together.

At the start of the game, you have only three minutes in which to take actions. Hourglass spaces you encounter along the way give you more time. If the sand timer ever completely runs out, all players lose the game: Your loitering has aroused suspicion, and the mall security guards nab you!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description from Boardgamegeek&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description from the publisher:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being stripped of all their possessions, a mage, a warrior, an elf, and a dwarf are forced to go rob the local Magic Maze shopping mall for all the equipment necessary for their next adventure. They agree to map out the labyrinth in its entirety first, then find each individual’s favorite store, and then locate the exit. In order to evade the surveillance of the guards who eyed their arrival suspiciously, all four will pull off their heists simultaneously, then dash to the exit. That&amp;#39;s the plan anyway…but can they pull it off?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magic Maze is a real-time, cooperative game. Each player can control any hero in order to make that hero perform a very specific action, to which the other players do not have access: Move north, explore a new area, ride an escalator… All this requires rigorous cooperation between the players in order to succeed at moving the heroes prudently. However, you are allowed to communicate only for short periods during the game; the rest of the time, you must play without giving any visual or audio cues to each other. If all of the heroes succeed in leaving the shopping mall in the limited time allotted for the game, each having stolen a very specific item, then everyone wins together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the game, you have only three minutes in which to take actions. Hourglass spaces you encounter along the way give you more time. If the sand timer ever completely runs out, all players lose the game: Your loitering has aroused suspicion, and the mall security guards nab you!&lt;/p&gt;

I have always had a love for board games, but never knew the vast world of what was out there until about 8 months ago.  Me and my wife bought a house and wanted a fun way to host events so we started having game nights.  First with Jackbox games, and the Nintendo Switch then started playing CAH (ugh IK, ive come a long ways from there) Resistance, and Ultimate Werewolf.  It was then that I found this subreddit, which then led to Youtube, then to Podcasts and it's all downhill from there!

 “How long have you been involved in the hobby?” 
Ive played a lot of party/social deduction games since I was in high school, thanks to my sister, but I would have to say I've really dove in 7 months ago when I went all in and got Spirit Island.  Probably not the best game to get right of the bat, but I watched a lot of tutorials and fell in love right away!

“What would you change about your collection if you could?” 
Cards Against Humanity, and Dear Lord need to go.  Not great games now that I have ventured out lol

My favorite game here lately has been Railroad Ink, Deception: Murder in Hong Kong, and Spirit Island.

My newest game is Railroad Ink.  This one is a lot of fun, and gets a play through just about every morning over a cup of coffee.

I’m looking to get either Terra Mystica or Gaia Project and I’m pretty torn on which to go for.

For those who played both - would it be best to get Terra Mystica first and go for Gaia Project later (as sort of an “expansion”)? That seems to be how most people got exposed to GP. Or just dive straight into GP, which on the balance sounds like the better game (for most)?

I'll give my favorite two.

[Jaipur](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/54043/jaipur): a 2 player set collection situation where at the start of the game both players are looking at nearly all the points available, and trying to grab up as much of those points as they can. The race is created because by waiting around, you could potentially earn some extra points not included in the zero sum set up, but by striking first you could get bigger points for acting quickly, while at the same time denying those bigger points to your opponent who may be caught on the backfoot because they felt they were better positioned than you to score in that set. It's a game all about timing. While being lucky helps, a keen sense of knowing when to strike can mitigate a lot.

[Hostage Negotiator](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/134253/hostage-negotiator): A very clever design that somehow gets away with using a zero sum point scoring mechanic in a 1 player game. At the start of the game the hostage taker has taken x number of hostages, and it's up to you to save as many as you can as quickly as you can, before the unstable hostage taker kills a number greater than or equal to half of x (although x may have increased in value by this time depending on events.) There is a lot I could say about why I like this game, and I will say that my enjoyment of it definitely increased once I started winning a bit more regularly. The one thing I'll note here, is that typically when I play solitaire games, I never think of myself as playing against an opponent, even if the solitaire version is described as being a ""bot."" I mostly think of the events not directly controlled by me as being luck events I'm having to respond to.  I find I win more often and have more fun when I think in these terms. When I play chess against my phone, I actually DO think of my phone as being something like an intelligent opponent. Even though philosophically I know it's not, in order for me to make the best moves I'm able, it's best if I pretend as though it's an intelligent agent reacting to my moves with designs and plans to foil me. Perhaps if I were in the ballpark of intellect of [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turochamp) I would more easily be able to get that sort of experience from a table top game. The reason I bring all this up, is just to compliment Hostage Negotiator on integrating the theme so well into the mechanics, that I sometimes DO feel as though I'm playing against an opponent, and sometimes even win while trying to understand and keep my ""opponents"" motives in mind.

Indeed, it is amazing to think that a lightweight engine builder about birds could generate so much demand and fighting among retailers and Stonemaier games. Instantly selling out as soon as it copies comes in, what is behind the urge, the need, to own this game?

**Concept/Theme** – The idea behind Wingspan is simple. You want to add or collect birds to your aviary. And it is a theme that comes out well in the game, though I would say it is more due to the production quality than the mechanics itself. As stated, the game is a lightweight engine builder and your goal is simple, collect enough birds, eggs and assorted food or cards above or under the birds, and complete your goals to win the game. All the cards are “unique” in the game, but that might be a bit of an exaggeration as most share broad elements with other cards and you see special powers repeat often. That said, the theme is a unique one or at least rare, and has appeal far outside of just bird watchers.

**Gameplay** – Gameplay is straightforward and consists of placing an action cube on one of 4 rows and taking that action. The 4 actions are basic at the beginning. You can play a bird, get food, lay eggs, or draw a card. That’s the core of the game, at least at the beginning. However, there is a cascading effect as you play, like any good engine builder should allow. Playing birds down each action column gets progressively more expensive but allows each of the lower rows to get more powerful. While you can only claim 1 food at the start of the game (chosen from among 5 dice rolled), you can later possibly get up to 3 food (4 if you discard). Laying eggs works the same, 2 at the start, but ultimately up to 4 or 5. Drawing cards works the same way.

In addition, playing the bird cards in their selected habitats (Woods/Food, Plains/Eggs, Wetlands/Draw Cards) can grant you additional abilities. Some get you instant effects, some will trigger every time you select the action row they are in, and some will trigger based on actions your opponents will take (but only once between turns). This makes planning out what combos you want vitally important, but also leads to the games lightweight status and its greatest weakness, which I’ll touch on in a moment.

Lastly, you have bonus cards. You start with 2 and select one of them, choosing one to keep. They are all generally collect X of Y style cards, giving you 3-4 points for a certain amount of birds, then closer to 8ish points if you have 5 or 6 or more of them. Furthermore, a fair amount of birds allow you to draw 2 more bonus cards, keeping one, giving you more clusters of points to aim for.

Each round also has a goal (there are 4 rounds) and the player who accomplishes the goal best gets the most points, with 2nd place getting less, third and fourth possibly getting none at all. There are two sides to the goal board as well, one that gives a friendly range of points from 5 to 1, dropping 1 point for each place. For more competitive people, you can try the other side, where points drop off much faster and may leave 3rd through 5th with no points at all. Regardless, at the end of each round, each player will place one of their action cubes on the space they placed at, leaving them with one less action to take each round, meaning each action becomes more and more valuable towards the end of the game.

At the end of the 4th round, players will total their points. Each bird played is worth a certain value, and players count their goal bonuses, bonus cards, cards tucked under their birds, and the number of eggs/food on top of their bird cards to see who won. A nice double-sided scorecard is provided, allowing easy tracking of a ton of games.

**Art/Aesthetics** – This is the wow factor to the game without a doubt. The linen feel rule book, the high-quality cards, the nice plastic cases for your bits, the wooden dice, the book style folding player boards and the opulent dice tower, the game sings of overproduction. Actually, I have never liked that word. Overproduction makes it sound like it is better made than it should be, but honestly, I wish almost all board games were of the quality that came in this box. Costs must be maintained, obviously, but if there is one thing Stonemaier games has to be proud of, it is how good their production values are.

https://imgur.com/a/OPdWaQL

The artwork for the bird cards, each unique, looks like it was pulled straight out of Autoban’s personal collection. The player boards are nice quality, and the dice tower, though clunky due to it loading the dice from the back, makes the game a stunner on the table. All in all, this is what I wish all board games looked like, in terms of production (but not style).

**Final Opinion** – Wingspan really is a fantastic game, and one that my wife and I both really enjoy. Our son could care less about it because of its theming, which I do understand. That however isn’t the one real flaw of the game, and what limits it in my opinion. It’s the lack of choice.

I love choice in games, even games with a fair amount of randomness should allow for meaningful choices and this here is the stumbling block I have with Wingspan. To illustrate this point, I’m going to briefly talk about two other engine builders I really enjoy, one lightweight, one heavier.

**Gizmos** is another game that looks great on the table. Your engine is built in the game by buying cards laid out on the table that, in turn, will affect the actions you are allowed to take, sometimes causing huge combo’s and chains that trigger over multiple actions. You are primarily limited by how much energy you have (and can have), what you can research, and what cards are showing. The game, however, offers you plenty of choice. You can reserve (hold) a card (later, perhaps multiple cards) that you cannot build right now. You have 3 rows of cards, 4 tier one, 3 tier two, and 2 tier 3 cards, offering you a selection of 9 cards to select from. Researching will allow you to pick any one of the tiers as well and research (draw) 3 cards (and potentially more) from that pile and select one to reserve or build immediately. So, while there is randomness in the game and the exact card you want may not be out, there is a wide variety of options to always draw from. A wide field of choice informs your gameplay.

**Terraforming Mars** is another game, maybe not a stunner on the table, that is all about building your engine. Almost everything is about the cards here (or standard projects, but anyone can do those at any time, if they can pay for them). You get a large hand of 10 cards at the start of the game to choose from. You do have to pay for them, but it is likely you wouldn’t want all of them anyway. Every generation (round) after that, you will draw 4 new cards to add to those that you have. Many players prefer to draft these, giving more nuance and strategy to the game by making you choose what to keep and what to risk giving to another player. While there are more ways to get cards, these are the primary ways to get them and you will receive a steady stream of cards throughout the game, forcing some hard choices. An expansion, **Prelude**, gives you even more choice by letting you choose 2 Prelude cards (from a hand of 4) that give you not only an early boost, but a possible focus to work towards, based on your starting hand. Again, it’s all about the choices and the number of cards, informing your gameplay.

Wingspan, on the other hand, starts you with 5, and you must pay your food to keep them, on a 1:1 basis. After that, a total of 3 cards will be available to draw if you choose the Draw action (and the draw pile of course, which is a blind draw). These 3 do not refill if you take one of them, forcing you to always be limited to only 3 cards. In addition, at the start of the game, taking a Draw action will only net you 1 card, and at a maximum, if you fill the row with birds, possibly 4 (if you pay extra for the 4th, otherwise 3). This keeps your hand very tight and small, and the only 3 cards visible severely restricts your choice.

This isn’t necessarily bad game design, nor am I claiming it as such, as it prevents players from making perfect engines, instead making the players adjust to what is available or the luck of the draw. I actually enjoy this aspect, as the game never lets you feel like you have an excess of anything. Unlike the games I mentioned earlier, where by the end of the game you feel you are getting tons of stuff, Wingspan goes from feeling starved to merely full, without any bloat generally. I find that a plus, generally.

However, and this is a big however and a limiting factor of the game, is that because resources and cards tend to be so limited to choose from and so tight, a starting hand that clicks together can give a player a massive head start over a players hand is a mishmash, and since there is a set number of turns and rounds in the game, that lead might be insurmountable, skill for skill with no chance to overcome it.

But, Wingspan is a lighter game and because of that, I feel it can get away with that. It joins the ranks of games like Ascension, where the random nature of the card play can greatly, through sheer luck, favor one player over the other. I still recommend it for anyone into the theme, or anyone looking for a beautiful, well produced game that plays in under an hour (maybe not with 4, but easily for 2-3) that works really well. It’s not perfect, and it probably doesn’t deserve the hype and attention level it has gotten, but for anyone looking for something family weight, you won’t go wrong with this game. If you can find it, that is.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is a game that has recently caused more controversy than Wingspan this year, I cannot think of one.

Costs must be maintained, obviously, but if there is one thing Stonemaier games has to be proud of, it is how good their production values are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/OPdWaQL""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/OPdWaQL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The artwork for the bird cards, each unique, looks like it was pulled straight out of Autoban’s personal collection. The player boards are nice quality, and the dice tower, though clunky due to it loading the dice from the back, makes the game a stunner on the table. All in all, this is what I wish all board games looked like, in terms of production (but not style).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Opinion&lt;/strong&gt; – Wingspan really is a fantastic game, and one that my wife and I both really enjoy. Our son could care less about it because of its theming, which I do understand. That however isn’t the one real flaw of the game, and what limits it in my opinion. It’s the lack of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love choice in games, even games with a fair amount of randomness should allow for meaningful choices and this here is the stumbling block I have with Wingspan. To illustrate this point, I’m going to briefly talk about two other engine builders I really enjoy, one lightweight, one heavier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gizmos&lt;/strong&gt; is another game that looks great on the table. Your engine is built in the game by buying cards laid out on the table that, in turn, will affect the actions you are allowed to take, sometimes causing huge combo’s and chains that trigger over multiple actions. You are primarily limited by how much energy you have (and can have), what you can research, and what cards are showing. The game, however, offers you plenty of choice. You can reserve (hold) a card (later, perhaps multiple cards) that you cannot build right now. You have 3 rows of cards, 4 tier one, 3 tier two, and 2 tier 3 cards, offering you a selection of 9 cards to select from. Researching will allow you to pick any one of the tiers as well and research (draw) 3 cards (and potentially more) from that pile and select one to reserve or build immediately. So, while there is randomness in the game and the exact card you want may not be out, there is a wide variety of options to always draw from. A wide field of choice informs your gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terraforming Mars&lt;/strong&gt; is another game, maybe not a stunner on the table, that is all about building your engine. Almost everything is about the cards here (or standard projects, but anyone can do those at any time, if they can pay for them). You get a large hand of 10 cards at the start of the game to choose from. You do have to pay for them, but it is likely you wouldn’t want all of them anyway. Every generation (round) after that, you will draw 4 new cards to add to those that you have. Many players prefer to draft these, giving more nuance and strategy to the game by making you choose what to keep and what to risk giving to another player. While there are more ways to get cards, these are the primary ways to get them and you will receive a steady stream of cards throughout the game, forcing some hard choices. An expansion, &lt;strong&gt;Prelude&lt;/strong&gt;, gives you even more choice by letting you choose 2 Prelude cards (from a hand of 4) that give you not only an early boost, but a possible focus to work towards, based on your starting hand. Again, it’s all about the choices and the number of cards, informing your gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wingspan, on the other hand, starts you with 5, and you must pay your food to keep them, on a 1:1 basis. After that, a total of 3 cards will be available to draw if you choose the Draw action (and the draw pile of course, which is a blind draw). These 3 do not refill if you take one of them, forcing you to always be limited to only 3 cards. In addition, at the start of the game, taking a Draw action will only net you 1 card, and at a maximum, if you fill the row with birds, possibly 4 (if you pay extra for the 4th, otherwise 3). This keeps your hand very tight and small, and the only 3 cards visible severely restricts your choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t necessarily bad game design, nor am I claiming it as such, as it prevents players from making perfect engines, instead making the players adjust to what is available or the luck of the draw. I actually enjoy this aspect, as the game never lets you feel like you have an excess of anything. Unlike the games I mentioned earlier, where by the end of the game you feel you are getting tons of stuff, Wingspan goes from feeling starved to merely full, without any bloat generally. I find that a plus, generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, and this is a big however and a limiting factor of the game, is that because resources and cards tend to be so limited to choose from and so tight, a starting hand that clicks together can give a player a massive head start over a players hand is a mishmash, and since there is a set number of turns and rounds in the game, that lead might be insurmountable, skill for skill with no chance to overcome it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, Wingspan is a lighter game and because of that, I feel it can get away with that. It joins the ranks of games like Ascension, where the random nature of the card play can greatly, through sheer luck, favor one player over the other. I still recommend it for anyone into the theme, or anyone looking for a beautiful, well produced game that plays in under an hour (maybe not with 4, but easily for 2-3) that works really well. It’s not perfect, and it probably doesn’t deserve the hype and attention level it has gotten, but for anyone looking for something family weight, you won’t go wrong with this game. If you can find it, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

The [Alfonso X](https://premiosalfonsox.geekout.com.ar/) awards have been going on for a few years now, as a means to push the (rather small) local industry to go a bit further and make nice games for everyone. This year I'm lucky to volunteer with the [group that organizes it](http://geekout.com.ar) and got to play all the games competing this year. I thought it might be nice to share my thoughts with the world now that the finalists (and some other promising games that didn't make it this year) have been announced :)

Of course all opinions here are my own and I have no clue how this award will turn out! My job as a volunteer is to collaborate in the group's YouTube channel and I've got nothing to do with the awards jury.

Without further ado, dem games:

# Fast Food

(2-10 players, 15min, [bgg entry](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/257080/fast-food))

It's a really fast-paced game of pattern recognition. You have custom dies to throw with different hamburger components (bread, tomato, lettuce, the actual patty, etc) and cards with all possible combinations. There's a salt shaker you have to grab and put on top of the correct combination, and you get a point if you do it right, you loose a point if you do it wrong. Personally, I think it's the weakest of the three contestants, both from a mechanics as from a production standpoint: it gets boring pretty fast, there's a lot of combinations so usually people make mistakes, and the salt shaker is actually a wooden doorknob - which is a great idea for a prototype but looks pretty bad on a finished game's box.

# Lunes

(""*Monday*"", 1 player, 10min, [bgg entry](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/259393/lunes))

This is the first local solitary that I know of, but then again I'm no expert. It's a lovely dungeon crawler where you have to collect three reports without getting caught by your boss (handled by AI) and escape the office. You've got some superpowers, like drinking coffee or taking a laxative, to help you fullfil your goals. It comes with a 10 level campaign and you can rearrange the tiles randomly to keep on playing. It's my favorite on this edition of the award for several reasons - the mechanics work, it's fun, the components are well designed and produced, and the theme works great for the game.

# El Camarero

(""The Waiter"", 2-10 players, 30min, [bgg entry](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/273657/el-camarero))

A memory game with a twist, El Camarero puts you on the place of a waiter who has to remember a lot of orders and get them right, lest they get a complaint. In the beggining everybody gets cards corresponding to a meal (complete with entry, beverage, main, side and dessert). These cards include variants (ie. sparkling water vs still water) and you have to choose one side of them. Once you've had time to go through everybody's cards, you turn them to face down and the actual game begins: 8 cards are dealt in the center of the table and players take turns to choose if they wanna say who's got one of those cards (and what specific variation of it!), or discard three of the cards shown. Whenever you notice someone's making a mistake, there's a lovely bell that comes with the game that you can push to interrupt and correct the player. The illustrations are really nice and the overall production level of the game is really good, the game is fun... but while playing it, I felt something was missing, like it was a bit of a lazy design. Don't get me wrong, it works, but in my personal opinion I'm not sure if it's the *best game* that local designers can make :)

# Honorable mentions

* I REALLY LIKED [BALLOTAGE](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/259498/ballotage)!!!! I mean it had issues but it was fun overall, and the theme is so very argentinian. I wish the designer had continued to playtest it and polish some issues before publishing it.
* [Las Divas](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/267356/las-divas) was a fun set collection game for me, although some have pointed out that the theme is barely held there with a pin - it probably could've been about *anything* and work the same.

Here soon I'm about to finish designing and fixing the kinks/mechanics of my game and I have thought about all the various and different approaches in getting my game into the hands of people, and I wanted to get some people's opinions on what would be the best way to approach this when the time comes.

I hope the title didn't confuse anyone. When I say, 'strictly digital', I'm not meaning taking a game and transitioning it into a 3d-environment as an executable; a la Tabletop Simulator. I mean packaging the game contents, boards, pawns, pieces, into workable file documents (.PSD files, .IND files, pdfs, etc.) and charging people for access to these specific items.

I'm thinking of setting this up on Itch.io as that seems like a great place for people to find new and upcoming games that allow you to essentially deliver .zip files to people that are willing to pay, but I'm also making this post to see if there is another medium or platform that may legitimately support this but do it better. I work full-time, and I don't want to see my game squandered by a publisher that will destroy the theme or rebrand my cards, and I don't have the time or logistical skill-set to complete a Kickstarter campaign at the moment.

I suppose my follow up question would be: does this seem viable to do? I was thinking of making the rulebook free, possibly include a list of all cards as an index and have people who want to play make the cards themselves (assuming they would jump this hurdle to start playing), or if people would pay $5-$10 for a structured page they can print-out and use immediately. This includes printing all the tokens, boards, etc.

Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks all.

I have come across some pointers here and there and I haven't really tried them all:

* Drive with a team of 2 cars. The one in pole also takes the last position with 2nd car, etc. Points are given for each place and player wins with combined highest score.
   * I really like this one as it seems to almost completely be balanced. However, it takes way more time to play a game as everyone has to go x2. Furthermore, it can only be achieved for up to 5 players.
* Give players extra WP (Wear Points) based on their starting position.
   * How many points should a player get for each row/place they are behind at the start? Would it make much of a difference?
* Let the player in last position have catch-up mechanism... For example adding extra spaces to their roll depending on their gear. +3 spaces if they are in 3rd gear (if they want it, and should be told upfront before they roll)
   * Not sure if this benefits enough players in the back and works in time for 1 lap.

I've run through a couple solo games and everything from Invaders seems to be present (and yes, I still get my butt whooped as Albion). It appears to be on sale for $1 off for now.

Steam page is here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1021190/Scythe_Digital_Edition__Invaders_from_Afar/

Here's hoping Wind Gambit and Rise of Fenris aren't too far behind.

EDIT:Here are the official release notes:

**What’s in this expansion?**

* 2 new factions: Clan Albion and the Togawa Shogunate, with their own starting positions, abilities and units available in two cosmetic variants
* 2 new mats: Innovative and Militant
* 4 new music tracks (2 per new faction) which have been added to the free Soundtrack DLC
* Support for local and multiplayer games with up to 7 players (instead of 5)
* Official rules changes for some Crimean and Polanian abilities in 6-7 players games [see the official expansion rules page 3]
* A new background for the main menu featuring the Togawa Shogunate

**Can I play with the new factions if I don’t own the expansion?**

If you don’t own the expansion you can’t play as Albion and/or Togawa, but you can play against them in online games created by owners of the expansion. This way, the community will not be split between owners and non-owners of the expansion.

**Can I toggle the expansion on and off if I own it?**

Yes: when you create a new game, whether local or online, you can choose to play with or without the expansion.

**What else is new?**

Happy Tuesday, /r/boardgames!

This is a weekly thread to discuss train games and 18xx games, which are a family of economic train games consisting of shared ownership in railroad companies. For more information, [see the description on BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/19/18xx). There’s also a subreddit devoted entirely to 18xx games, /r/18xx, and a subreddit devoted entirely to **[Age of Steam](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4098/age-steam)**, /r/AgeOfSteam.

Here’s a nice guide on [how to get started with 18xx](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/4sygx3/how_to_get_started_with_18xx/?st=iqny4loj&amp;sh=c01b5d88).

Feel free to discuss anything about train games, including recent plays, what you're looking forward to, and any questions you have. 

If you want to arrange to play some 18xx or other train games online, feel free to try to arrange a game with people via /r/playboardgames.
